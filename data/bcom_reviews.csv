5547,original,great potential to be at an advanced level,"This place has great potential to be at an advanced level. Hygiene is superficially good, but it requires general maintenance for a certain period because the floor and carpets need more attention. I also think that when someone has booked for a week like us or more, it would be desirable to provide a vacuum cleaner for the tenants to maintain during their stay. I would definitely come to the same place again if I want to come to Prague again. All city transport is close, a very practical location.","In this accommodation, we had exactly what we needed, comfort ""like at home"".

Code would only be sent after paying the tax.
Additionally, when traveling with small children (and entering children for the booking in Booking app), children are charged and a cot has to be paid on top, which essentially means that payment for children is higher than for adults.

In addition, having travelled with a small child with a pushchair, we found it rather inconvenient to get to the flat, as there are several flights of stairs up and down and doorways to cross to reach the lift and then the flat door.

5390,original,,,Location is perfect but not suitable for person who avoid stairs. 66 stairs we have to walk to get on the 3rd floors very painful with our 3 suitcase.
5385,original,Very good for a couple who likes cultural activities and good food,,"We stayed for two weeks and enjoyed our time at this apartment.

The location is excellent. Just a short walk to the Vltava River and the streets of Ujezd and Stefanikova, which are lined with nice restaurants and convenient shops. There’s also a tram station nearby, and the entrance to Petrin Hill is just a short walk away - we recommend taking a stroll up the hill for panoramic views of Prague.

The building is peaceful and with a little interior garden. However, the elevator does not reach the floor of the main entrance, so you’ll need to go up or down one flight of stairs to access it. The same applies to the apartment itself - the elevator doesn’t reach the apartment floor.

The apartment is very well-equipped, though we had some difficulty figuring out how the heater worked since the instructions were only in Czech. However, the staff was quick to assist us via Booking.com’s messaging service and WhatsApp, which was much appreciated."
5382,original,Lovely little place! Would stay again.,"The living-room sofa is ok, but not the comfiest. Could do with a foot stall for those cosy nights in with a film. I was there for a long stay and for medical reasons and wanted to chill but found it a quite difficult to get comfy. The curtains in the living-room are a bit see-through, for me personally just made me a bit paranoid especially coming out the bathroom in a towel ant night. Other than that everything was amazing!","The bed is so comfortable, love the kitchen, the shower is absolutely amazing! Bathroom is really lovely. I love the dinning area and all the natural light and windows."
5379,original,"Nice location, lack of elevator is a problem","Accessibility
The apartment is on the fourth floor of the building, with no elevator to get there - this was a huge discomfort which we somehow knew in advance but did not expect it to be that difficult for us. 118 steps from the ground floor to the apartment - the steps were low in height which helped overall. 
Upon checking out we met one of the apartment managers just outside our door and informed us that they will be installing an elevator by next year. 

Apartment furnishing and accessories
There were a few small things that we found to have room for improvement. First of all, there was no closet in the main bedroom which made it difficult to hang our clothes. The only closet hanging area was located at the entrance hall next to the main door, which upon our arrival was full of dirty laundry from previous occupents (the laundry were collected by one representative once we communicated this with the management). 
On the other hand, the bedroom was missing a mirror which was necessary but not available. 

Bathroom
The bathroom did not have sufficient light above the basin, making it a little difficult to see through the mirror. 
The water drain in the shower was always slow and often water would come out of the shower.","The location is really nice, just 3-4 minute walk from the old town square.
The apartment itself is modern, bright and spacious. 
The communication with the staff was excellent and easy. Every concern addressed to the management was always well received and resolved where possible. Check in was easy and simple. 
Since we were 3 people in the apartment, the sofa bed was set up to accommodate us. The mattress was comfortable enough and did not cause any sleeping issues."

It is situated adjacent to the Vienna Hotel.  Prague Castle and the city's attractions are readily accessible.  The transport network is both extensive and ubiquitous.  I personally walked to the majority of them.

 The facility is architecturally quite charming, with regard to its physical conditions.  Upon my arrival, it was immediately apparent that they were exceedingly meticulous in their adherence to sanitation regulations.  Although I was alone, the kitchen is readily accessible to two individuals.  There was an abundance of equipment in the kitchen.  The television and other electronic devices are of the most recent generation.

Additionally, the stairs at the entrance of the building were unexpected and made it challenging to navigate with a baby stroller, especially after shopping. The shower could also use some renovations, as it tends to make the entire bathroom wet if not used carefully. On a positive note, customer service was excellent and responsive.

The building was quiet and we slept very well. We parked in the underground garage and took all our luggage up in the lift which stopped very close to the apartment. It‘s worth mentioning here that there are two lifts in the garage, and the one you need to get to 3A is not the one next to the car space. It‘s on the other side of the garage, only a short walk away. We were there in February and the apartment was warm and the heating very efficient. The staff at Prague Days were very helpful and responded very quickly to our messages. The apartment is in a side road next to Wencelas Square where there are many shops, cafés, bars and restaurants. The main square in the old town is about a 10-15 minute walk away. We had a brilliant week and will definitely stay here again."

5084,original,Imposible to stay at this location,"The lockbox was chained to a drain pipe, which from my perspective is not a professional way of handing over the keys. 
As soon as we have opened the door to the apartment, a dusty and damp smell hit us, telling us that the appartment was not properly cleaned and it might have issues.
After a quick scan of the apartment we have seen that the kitchen, refrigerator and bathroom (among other things) were not properly clean.
We have called the owner of the apartment and people on PragueDays support were trying to find execuses that the dusty and damp smell are caused by the previous visitors being smokers but we didn't agree. Being a non-smoker, I would immediately recognised the cigaretes smell.
In the end, they have sent someone to verify all our complaints and while waiting we have found the biggest &quot;surprise&quot; of the apartment (aka. issue): the dampness on the walls. 
From the attached photos it can be seen that a dehumidifier exists at the location, telling us that the owner was aware all these issues and did nothing to resolved. 
By this last issue, the missing bags in the trash bin, stains around the apartment - on the electric stove, furniture or the dust on furniture are really small things.
Given the fact that we have arrived pretty late at the location and the appartment was unhabitable not even for one night, the property owner not even tried to find us another location to stay and in the middle of the night we had to find on our own a place to stay for which we eventually we had to pay a large amount since it has not been booked in advance like this one was.
I would not recomnend this location to anyone.
We demand compensation for the extra amount we had to pay for having to do a last minute booking for our entire stay in Prague.
Also Booking was not willing to help us to find a similar location and on top of that no one took the accountability.",Nothing

5042,original,Good apartment with superb location,"The bathroom was bare, except for mirror cabinet . A grab bar and  towel racks  needed  to keep stuff while in shower and prevent any falls.","This 4th floor apartment was neat, well equipped and as shown in pics . Excellent location with tram station 70 metres and subway 200 metres away, small mart in opp. building and supermart 250 metres.

5040,original,Highly recommended!,That we couldn't stay longer! :-),"Great location (close to the metro with a quick undergroud train to town etc, also close to tram stops), spacious, clean, exceptionally well equipped for self-catering.

5038,original,,"Many times happened issues with main door locker, and it has been taken a full afternoon of Wednesday to fix and also saturday morning another 2 hr.

Kitchen is nicely stocked.Location is good with transportation within walkingdistance.
5024,original,,,"Small room but very comfortable and has everything you need for your stay. It's big enough for one person and maybe a couple at a stretch. The location is very central, right next to a metro station (the green line) and a tram stop, so it is very accessible especially coming in or going to the airport. The communication with the hosts was very smooth; all the self check-in instructions were very clear 👌"
5023,original,Very very very good value,On the last day during checkout the lift did not work for some reason. Not their fault. But we needed to drag our heavy luggages down the stairs,"They have complete amenities. Everything you need for a good stay. Kitchen stuffs complete, got iron, heater, hot water sufficient, TV. 

They only gave 1 set of towels when we arrived but they quickly sorted it out after we told them which was great service."
5021,original,Lovely time,"All good, just sometimes could be noisy",Perfect location
5019,original,Nice room but could improve a few things,"There are no window coverings and I felt very exposed. Anyone can look into the apartment at night and see everything except the bathroom. I also found the bathroom to be a little awkward. The tub is elevated and the curtain doesn't go down far enough to always keep the water in. There is no elevator and it was 88 steps to the room, which isn't that big of a deal incept initially when you have luggage. I would also appreciate an ottoman to put my feet up since the couch isn't wide enough to lay down on.",The studio itself was lovely and I really appreciated the washing machine. It was comfortable and had everything I could need.
5017,original,RECOMMENDED,"- extremely loud whole night coz of drunk teenagers, garbage trucks if you like to sleep with windows open
- poor sound isolation from neighbors
- no place in a wardrobe for a suitcases storage
- bathroom smells (though not THAT bad)
- there was no hot water 2 days during my stay
- security? A MAN OPENED MY DOOR WITH KEYS AND RUSHED IN WHILE I WAS HAVING REST NAKED! I can bearly say what he wanted, coz he couldnt explain it well, probably he is a plumber?)))))))","For a very experienced traveler it was great:
- clean and cozy

We had a wonderful time and highly recommend this place!","We had a fantastic stay in this apartment! The location couldn't be better—very convenient for travelers arriving by train, as it's just a short walk from the station and equally close to the city center. Despite being so central, the neighborhood is very quiet, which made our stay even more relaxing. There are plenty of attractions nearby, along with a tram stop and a fantastic coffee shop with delicious coffee just around the corner.

The apartment was spotless, comfortable, and well-equipped, making it easy to feel right at home. The check-in process was seamless, and the team was very responsive and helpful throughout our stay.

The location in Prague 5 was perfect – we could easily walk across the bridges to the city center. We were also lucky with parking, as we always found a spot right across from the building. Using the EasyPark app, we could pay or extend parking time easily, and at €14.50 per day, it was both affordable and convenient.

4924,original,Great location and comfortable,The apartment was slightly warm at night and the temperature could not be changed (or we couldn’t find out how).,"The apartment is situated in a great location, which felt safe. People have complained about noise in previous comments, but we did not hear a thing! Definitely good value for money."
4919,original,Suitable apartment for one person on a short stay but definitely not suitable for a couple,Cramped for two people. Uncomfortable bed and pillows.

4881,original,"GOOD APARTMENT, GREAT LOCATION, LAYOUT SUITED FOR SPECIFIC GROUPS","Wish it had a dishwasher, the bathing area is a bit tight due to the washing machine. Could do with less beds or smaller beds in the back 2 room so they were more space to move around. I think a floorplan would help illustrate better the layout of the apartment since it may not suit everyone's needs, it was a bit hard to figure out when booking.","Very modern and brand new finishes. Bed and bed linen were very nice and fresh. A bit tight for 3 beds, good for close friends and family with small kids since the last 2 bedrooms are actually are railroad style where you have to access one through the other and have a glass door divider only. To compensate for lack of cupboards they have provided open hanging racks. The living room, Kitchen and Dinning Table is inside the 3rd Master Bedroom. Kitchen is a bit small for so many beds/potential of people staying and doesn't come with dishwasher. It's good for certain groups but the setup may not work for everyone. Nevertheless very well designed and very responsive and thoughtful staff. Amazing location very walkable to old town and Jewish quarter. Great Value for the price. Really like the brand Prague Days, had booked this and their one bedroom for a big family trip. And it worked out well for our propose."

Also, the kitchen was nice, and the bathrooms were very good too."

It is close to the main train station, tram and metro is super close.  We really like the location and enjoyed our stay."
4785,original,Would come back,"It was very warm when we arrived so we were happy to see two fans. Unfortunately we soon found that one of the fans did not work at all and the other was so bent that it would tip over when turning it on. We also found that it was quite noisy in the hallway and apartment above us some nights and the last days of our stay someone would often go out to the garden for a cigarette and it would fill the apartment with the smell and smoke, which woke us all up. Nevertheless we would definitely go back here.","The location is very good. We often travel to Prague and like to stay in Vinohrady which is just out of the busy centre but has a lot of restaurants and nice shops to offer (and of course Riegrovy Sady). Plus the apartment is on the ground floor which was a first for us, saved us from endless stairs to climb. Bed was comfortable, kitchen well equipt, and the apartment was spacious. During our stay we received a message from Prague days with information about a food festival which was very thoughtful. Check in and - out was very easy."

They really should have given us 2 as 2 of us where in one bed and my daughter was on her own and that bed was in a different direction. It was no comfort for the heat though. We had to leave the windows open to get any breeze we could. The square was very nosie. But we had to leave the windows open. 
The bathroom was not that great. Some power points didn't work.",The Property is in a brilliant location.

But we were 4, and that's why I put 9/10. For 4 persons this pretty shower with glass door became a bit of a problem :) plus, a common space is not large and for 2 people there's plenty of space, but for 4 we never could actually gather all together.","The apartment looks and feels really great, it's very well equipped and clean! Windows are inside a very quiet inner space, the house is old but freshly renovated and just benefits from that. Everything is well thought of, so staying there was a real pleasure. Plus, it is possible to park nearby! Parking is just paid during the weekdays, but payment with the app is easy. Starting 8PM Friday and until Monday morning the parking is free and there were plenty of space available. The host is the most friendly one can imagine - we didn't see anybody in person, but they were always available in the Booking chat."
4701,original,,Heavy traffic causes noise. The host gives earplugs to use :),Very good contact with the host. Easy to understand check-in instructions. Optimal equipment of the apartment. The tram stop and shops are close to the apartment. 20 minutes travel to old town by tram.

4697,original,,"Even though it says there's a TV and streaming services in both rooms on the reservation page, there was no television in one of the rooms. Air conditions were portable and the exhaust was inside the room, so they were completely useless.
Some amenities should be renewed in long stays like detergant and toilet paper.","The location was perfect, only a few minutes away from the old city centre. Rooms were spacious, clean and well equipped. As we stayed 1 week, having some equipments like washing/drying machine and coffee machine was really critical. The staff were very friendly and helpful.

4614,original,That was great.,"The checkout time was quite strict. When we attempted to check out at 10:10, a housekeeping staff member was already at the door, visibly unhappy, and we received a message reminding us that we had not yet checked out. Allowing a grace period of around 30 minutes would be helpful in such cases. Overall, I would still rate this place a 9/10.","The location, apartment decoration and cleanliness were perfect. Everything we needed was available in the apartment. We all liked to stay that building."

Very clean, cozy, good area, nice balcony!"

Access was easy with key code. I didn't need to contact staff during stay but they were very responsive prior to visit."

4595,original,Satisfactory as per what was stated on the website,"A microwave needs to be provided for ready to heat meals. It gets quite warm and therefore a fan is essential. The mattresses are too soft, possibly softened with use and need to be improved.","Location was good, easy access to Central Prague and to public transport.

4583,original,,That I didn't book an extra night! 😉,"Everything! Lovely studio with everything you need, nice colours, spacious. I like the entrance hall with lots of clothes storage, extra quilts etc.
The wardrobe has a full length mirror too.
There's little notes guests can write &amp; pin about their stay as you come in the door :)
The bathroom was modern &amp; lots of space to put things.
It was quiet too as there's two sets of windows. 
The complimentary bottle of wine is a lovely touch too! Thank you.
The extension cord was very handy too for charging my phone near the bed. 
There's a lift so it's easy with luggage.
Good selection of toiletries &amp; extras.
The owners care about your stay too, they emailed after the first night to make sure everything was ok.

I'd stay here again &amp; highly recommend it"

4502,original,,Everything was up to the mark.,"The apartment is located in Vinohrady, Prague 2 a minute away from Namesti Miru subway station. Vinohrady is a beautiful neighborhood, with varied architecture and green parks. From Namesti Miru the old town area is a short train ride away. In fact, it is well connected to any of the tourist areas in Prague. The apartments are very comfortable and well furnished and it is a pretty quiet area. The kitchen/pantry is well stocked with equipment. A gym and laundry room are available on the ground floor of the building. Can easily recommend it for a stay in Prague."

Uncomfortable chairs in dining area.",Location
4474,original,Prague is a beautiful location but do yourself a favour and DO NOT use this apartment.,The apartment was dirty and quality of bedding and service was poor.  The beds were not made and linen was only provided for 1 bed when we specifically asked for 2 and naturally paid for a 2 bedroom apartment.  The loft bed was unusable and the bed was not made with no covers for the doona.  The mattress was dirty and stained (disgusting to see).  The loft was very squishy and the photo on the website is deceptive making the loft look a lot bigger than it is.  The plant you see in the picture is just a mini  plant and not actually a small shrub as depicted.  There was only about 30cm from the mattress to the ceiling in the loft .  The paint on the ceiling seemed mouldy and unclean and we didn’t want to be close to it.  We could not use this facility as we could not crouch down low enough to use the bed.  The apartment is in fact a 0 bedroom apartment (although being rented as a 2 bedroom) as the main bedroom is simply a bed in the middle of the lounge room.  It was a terrible experience and dirty and dusty.  We called the service number and to get help and they were rude and unhelpful.  One of us had to sleep on top of the couch (with no sheets) and use a dirty blanket that we found on the lounge. We would not recommend this apartment  to anyone.,The location was perfect
4466,original,Great apartment close to all of the sites!,"Retrieving the key and lock box was interesting!  Also, more help with parking would have been nice.

4432,original,"Excellent location, clean, quiet, comfortable.",A slightly reduced pitch would have made the loft bed's vertical fixed ladder easier to use. I would have gladly put recyclables into appropriate containers if there had been any.,"Bottle of wine on the kitchen counter upon arrival was a nice touch. Kitchen was well equipped for making breakfast &amp; coffee. Skylights that opened and with light-tight shades made the most of the top-floor apartment. Decent WiFi, plus TV with multiple streaming services."
4431,original,,"The apartment is located on the 3rd floor so definitely not for elderly people or people with health issues. Check-in was very unpleasant, as you had to pick the key from a lock box located outside the apartment about 50m away attached on a fence panel. Unfortunately, I was informed the lockbox got stolen as I struggled to remove the attached lockbox from the fence and had to pay 1700 Czech currency. The neighbour will lock the main entrance door at night so, we were locked outside the apartment building for nearly an hour. Nobody answered the call and after banging the door continuously for a while, someone opened the magnetic door.",The location is great and the apartment was clean.

I found this very convenient as a starting point. The property is well maintained, provides guest with very good service. I liked the self check in, entering the building and rooms using a code. There is a small gym and laundry room on the ground floor. I stayed in a studio for 2 with kitchenette, which perfectly fits me a solo traveler. Situated to the yard, the room was super quiet, which I appreciated as being sensitive to noise. The bed was big enough and comfortable. Slept well. The property provides strong and stable WiFi, I could work easily. TV with Netflix. Everything went well during this stay. Thank you."

4237,original,Expensive for what it is,"No sign of staff anywhere , the door locking system when you leave your apartment seems so sketchy to me as it auto locks , hate having to put the number in when there’s people right next door who could look or overhear . Very loud at night our sleep was disturbed by noisy drunks outside and no staff to tell them to be quiet also our air conditioning wasn’t working so had to close the window due to the drunks so it was hot and stuffy. In addition to this someone was very obviously smoking on the first floor in their apartment so it stunk until we got into our room. Not nice to have to walk through with a child. Was a costly stay perhaps due to Easter they bumped up the prices as my family have had others stay for the same length and it was no where near as expensive apparently which was disheartening to read . In addition to this there was very minimal hot water . After a long day we all wanted a wash before bed , I was in the shower for maybe 10 minutes then it turned freezing cold which meant my son and husband couldn’t shower, this was exceptionally disappointing given the price",It was spacious which was good .

4216,original,Beautiful spacious apartment perfect for a family visiting Prague.,We drove and there is no parking. We hoped for a close parking garage and it’s recommend to reserve a parking spot with Mr Park It. We didn’t know this until the day before. The parking garages that were close to the apartment were full so we had to park farther than we hoped. BUT it all worked out ☺️,The location was great! Bus stop right outside to take you into old town. The apartment itself was spacious! Two showers were amazing! We loved that there were two levels and the top floor/bedroom has a balcony.  The building and check in was easy and we were definitely thankful for the elevator in the building.

4128,original,,"There were quite a few issues. The most important one which affected us the most was that we had no gas at all.
Thus, we had NO heating, NO hot showers (thereby unable to clean ourselves), and we couldn't cook for our entire stay there (6 days and 5 nights). As a result my mom got sick and we resorted to wiping ourselves with hot water boiled from kettle - this felt somewhat degrading as three grown adults on vacation. Apart from no hot showers and the heating issues (when it was only 5 degrees outside), the complete lack of gas made it impossible for us to cook.
Being able to cook was one of the reasons why we booked an apartment with a kitchen to begin with, as one of us has dietary requirements which we need to cater for ourselves. We operated under the assumption that we were able to cook so we bought groceries worth of a couple of days, most of which were wasted in the end. Consequently, this led to us having to eat out, mounting to additional costs that we did not plan for. We were informed by the management at first the issue would be fixed the next day, but after 2 days they told us it was due to a problem in the entire apartment complex so it wasn't their fault. However, when the shower and the heating still failed after the problem in the complex had been fixed, we were informed that the equipments in the apartment itself were broken. These repeated excuses made us feel like we were being fooled around, and the management claimed that these things &quot;happen&quot; and are &quot;out of their control&quot;. Nevertheless, even though this may be true for the issue in the apartment complex, I believe it is supposed to be a vendor's responsibility to look after and maintain the accomodation and make sure equipments are functional before guests check in. On top of these main issues, we also experienced other issues (e.g.",Location was 10 out 10. You are literally in the middle of everything.

However they responded after 3 days with a suggestion to move to another apartment after we had already settled and our stay was only 7 days, with no time to waste. We opted for a compensation which we are still waiting to receive and get a response from the property. The elevator was not working for 3 days as well during our stay and only after we complained in the whole building, did the association fix the issue. however the boiler is not fixed and please consider when booking this apartment as we are yet to receive compensation. we are back to our countries (3 of us at 3 different regions)",

The temperature was around 17.5-18°C. Only when we were checking out, we noticed that the heater wasn't even connected, it was below the table and not visible. The instructions should be clearer. When we were checking in, the instructions to open the lockbox also wasn't clear, so we had to call them at 22:00 to figure out how to open the box. I'd recommend that the instructional video should be sent to everyone beforehand. The heater in the bathroom said that it was ready for shower but still the water was pretty cold. And the sticker on the heater even says that the heater is on and we should not fiddle with it. Overall, instructions for everything could have been clearer.","The location was fantastic, it was super close to Wenceslas square and it took hardly fifteen minutes to walk to the old town square as well.

3890,original,It&#39;s good place but far from restaurants and stores,"The wifi is highly unstable,  it constantly threw me off the network!!! and there's no access to the router to reset it. The router in the apartment is not the one I used to connect to the Internet, so it might be in some other apartment which explains the quality of the connection.

Also, additional pans and pots as well as toaster could be useful in the kitchen

The &quot;smart&quot; home system is very sluggish which makes it hard to manage it, like setting up the temperatures in rooms. Also, turning off/on lights in rooms turned out to be a real challenge for us.","a modern apartment, unexpectedly spacious, a big balcony and free underground parking, the bed was big and comfy"

3839,original,"Excellent location, could change a few little things but overall very nice apartment","The apartment needs blackout curtains, every time someone came through the entrance the automatic light shone right through the bedroom, disturbing us through the night! The bunk bed was a little too high especially for young children, fortunately our daughter was 17 but she struggled slightly! In the fifth floor wasn’t a problem for us but should probably be more obvious.","Very Clean, had everything you needed!"
3836,original,,"Looking for the key to the apartment was a hassle esp we arrived at night and it snowed. The number on the lockbox wasn’t the same as the one in the email. So we ended up trying all the lockboxes (4 of them) with the code  given, finally we were successful on the 4th one. The apartment was spacious but the toilet room was too small, the tiniest I’ve ever seen. I’m 5’1” and I hit my head on the door  knob, toilet paper wasn’t provided.

Took an early shower the next day just to be safe and there’s hot water. Obviously fallen ill and had to cancel some of my plans the next day, not the best experience.

Sofa was not neat when we arrived and was pulled out. When we pushed it together we found glass shards that we had to vacuum away but luckily they provided a vacuum. 
Toilet brush had previous people „gifts“ in it.

The room was spacious with air conditioning in the living area and the bedroom. It was really well kept and very clean when I arrived. It had all the tools needed to be able to cook your own stuff including a kettle and a coffee machine as well. It is only a stones throw from the main city centre which makes it really easy should you want to go site seeing, see many of the attractions or do a little bit of food shopping in the vast range of stores.. In my case I went to Lidl. 

I did have a slight problem with the coded lock on my door at approx 00:00, however, I called the out of hours number that was provided to me on Check In and right away someone answered and managed to resolve my problem within under a minute of me calling them and spoke excellent English and was extremely helpful.  

The noise outside of the apartment and outside of the street was non existent so I could get an excellent nights sleep. 

The washing machines included within the hotel were free to use and they even provided washing pods that you could use which was a brilliant help and was very handy."

I forgot my kindle there and they called me to say. Amazing and honest people. 
Even a bottle of wine was waiting for us. We didn’t drink and left there but we felt so welcome. It’s great we don’t need keys as it’s all codified. It’s modern inside, all looking new in a medieval city. When we comeback to Prague, I hope we can stay there again so.

Not related to the apartment, but in case you are looking for a place to eat out, avoid the nearby Ombinus pizzeria at all costs!!! An Eighties socialist place with the worst food we’ve had in years.","Recently renovated, tastefully decorated apartment. Nice view of St Vitus cathedral from the living room roof window. The kitchen is well equipped. The apartment was clean and comfortable for our family. The area is safe and quiet with elegant apartment blocks, on the edge of the city center, with excellent public transport connections. There is a shopping center with a big Tesco two tram stops away and a smaller Tesco Exptress two blocks from the apartment."
3686,original,Superb,,"The apartment was spacious, beautiful, the self check out process was quick and easy. The place was equipped with everything we could need and more (earplugs and sleeping masks were provided for example). Definitely best value for money."
3685,original,,"We chose the MIZU apartment for our family trip to Prague. Since we have two children, my husband and I wanted a separate bedroom. In the description of the apartment, as well as on the reservation confirmation, it was written &quot;One bedroom apartment&quot;. Unfortunately, our MIZU Prague days apartment did not have a bedroom, but a double bed separated from the rest of the space by a wall. For our personal reasons, it was very important for us to have a separate bedroom. Despite this, after our complaint, and after correspondence with several employees of MIZU Prague days, we did not encounter any understanding or willingness to at least somehow atone for this obvious deception. The space is beautiful, harmoniously designed, however, they could work on furnishing the space (I am attaching photos of the destroyed carpet, moldings, fallen towel holders and a worn towel). The location is phenomenal.",

3643,original,the city&#39;s attractions offset the difficulties of getting to the center .I will return to Prague aga,"The keys to the apartment were collected to the minute - as we know, there are time slots when traveling (earlier arrival), lack of understanding and the possibility of moving in 30 minutes earlier - yellow card","the location of the building in a quiet district, the size of the rooms and the quality consistent with the photos on booking, a coffee machine that saves the mornings,"
3642,original,Thank you,"The apartment entrance needs more cleanliness, in addition to the noise outside and the lack of parking for the car",". The furniture of the apartment is new and modern, with a modern design. The apartment is spacious and tidy. The entrance to the apartment needs more cleanliness. There is noise outside from the bars. It is very suitable for young people and not suitable for families. In addition to the lack of parking, we faced difficulty in providing parking for the car. It took nearly an hour until I found a parking space, as the The host helped me search for Parking by sending links to search for Parking. Thank you"
3640,original,Great stay in a great location!,"The biggest issue we had was with the keys pickup - the lockbox was moved and this information was not included into the welcoming message, which made us spend some time looking for it. On the other hand the emergency phone worked fast and efficient, we were also told that next guests would get the proper location of the lockbox.

There were also some smaller issues within the premise - some mold in the bathroom, one very loudly creaking wooden panel on the floor - but nothing serious.","The location was perfect! Tram stop a few meters away, grocery store next corner, metro station (and a couple of bus stops) two blocks away, but all surprisingly peaceful &amp; quiet - what more may one want?

If you travel with kids you may be happy with the TV set with some apps preinstalled (like Disney+) for evening cartoons."
3635,original,Modern apartment with good location!,"It could be cleaner, but nothing horrible. 
The sofa is not the best for two person.","Location is great. 
The bedroom’s bed was comfortable."
3631,original,Perfect choice for family trip to Prague.,We were satisfied. Thanx.,"Accommodation fullfilled our expectations. Nice, clean, quiet (it is important for us because of kids). Metro station and tram a few steps away. A lot of coffeteries and pubs with good food arround. Photos are real."
3621,original,,Check in was confusing and delayed,"So clean, new comfortable and spacious"
3617,original,Good and sunny place to live. The equipments are good.,"It is on the 8th floor, no lift. For those who are not in a good shape, it is a bit tough.","When the equitements are broken, the landlord sent their stuffs to repair fast."
3613,original,"Sufficient for 2 night stay, but for longer period of time I would be lacking quality sleep for sure","There were no curtains in the flat, we received sleeping mask as a substitution but is wasnt very comfortable.

Also, not that much space for your luggage.",Appartment is located in the heart of Karlin which is great location!
3611,original,Excellent modern  apartments in a special city,,"You’ll love the light modern well equipped apartments of a good size and excellent standard.
It’s 30mins walk to the heart of the old town, 15 mins walk to the national mutant railway station.
BoLT taxi app is excellent.Trams/ metro 2 mins away 
There are shops for supplies and local places to eat on your doorstep.
Staff are attentive to your needs."

3594,original,,,"Amazing location, spacious apartment, friendly staff, we had issue with video projector, they gave their best to repair, addressed our needs quickly, no parking, but its not their fault, really nice bathroom and kitchen with all appliances."
3586,original,Nice place in the heart of Prague,Everything was good and nothing to complain or say,"Everything went smooth, the check-in and checkout is all automatic and no need to pass over reception or other steps to take keys. WiFi working good. Location of the place was also great, very close to the public transportation."
3579,original,,Internet was unreliable. Electricity would turn off when doing computer work or watching TV and then I'd have to wave my arms wildly.,"Location, laundry, cleanliness, building, room was clean and had all the things needed."
3568,original,Definitely I&#39;d recommend this place to stay.,"Not a problem, just a minor inconvenience: The chairs could be more comfortable. The overhead light was a little lacking.","Location: The location is very good: I'd say, it's the &quot;geographical center&quot; for Pražský hrad, Vyšehrad, Staroměstské náměstí, and other &quot;must-see&quot; Prague places. The Vltava embankment is just two minutes away. On the other hand, the place is very quiet and away from the main tourist routes.
Facilities: I'd say, everything you need you'll find in the apartment, and even more. Except for the microwave oven (but maybe I just couldn't find it? :)), but the electric kettle and the stovetop solve all the problems. The balcony is wonderful. The bed is perfect.
There was no TV, but for me, that's an advantage, not a disadvantage.
Cleanliness: no complaints, everything was perfect.
Staff: very friendly and helpful people. Special thanks #1 for the clear and understandable information about where and how to get the keys on arrival. Special thanks #2 for all those little gifts that I found in the apartment on arrival. Special thanks #3 for the information about the ongoing festival :) I really felt myself a guest, not just a customer.
Hints: 1) Wi-Fi login/password can be found in the brochure on the window sill. 2) The best supermarket nearby IMHO is Penny (Arbesovo nám./ul, Štefánikova 248/32, 150 00 Praha, Czechia) — 5-10 minutes by foot. I'd not recommend it to visit all those little minimarkets nearby. Not bad, but just be attentive when paying.
Summary: Definitely I'd recommend this place to stay."
3567,original,"Cozy, comfortable and well-stocked apartment in a nice location.",,"I loved the apartment. It’s spacious, clean, the kitchen was well stocked and there are many good restaurants and coffees in the area. The tram departure point is also very close."
3565,original,,"As mentioned by others, could be a bit loud in the morning (trash truck for example). Parking entrance is a bit narrow for a bigger car but still fine.","Location is convenient - bars, restraunts, shops and river are nearby. The apartment itself is big enough for 2-4 persons. Private parking is also a plus"
3558,original,Nice apartment for families with small children,,"Nice location in a quiet street but only a few minutes walk from a public park with a nice play ground and only ten minutes walk from the city center.

While the confirmation email (after payment) asks for sleeping arrangements, nowhere is it mentioned that if you do not specify that you would be using both bedrooms, that there would be an extra charge for bedding. When I book a two bedroom apartment, I expect both bedrooms to be usable when I arrive for the price paid. I do not think it is appropriate to charge extra for this, nor do I accept that asking about sleeping arrangements after bookings have been confirmed is an appropriate way to not make up a second bedroom. I would suggest this is clearly asked before booking, rather than as part of long confirmation messages after the event.",Location was great and instructions very clear to get in.
3543,original,,"Everything was perfect, just an ensuite in the lloft would be helpful but didn't bother much.","Glad we chose the apartmwnt. Perfect for a family stay. Clean, comfortable and so well furnished. Exceptional stay. Would highly recommend."
3538,original,"Disappointing, inadequate and not worth the money.","No meet and greet, no showing of how things work around the apartment. An already late check in of 4pm was extended to 7pm, apparently due to cleaning issues. Only one room was made up, even though on several occasions we had stipulated we needed both rooms. Double beds with very thin single duvets, is uncomfortable and unacceptable! TV wasn’t set up and should have been checked prior to our arrival. Cooking utensils sadly lacking, two very small cheap pans were  simply inadequate to cook a meal for 2 let alone a party of 6 (which is what this apartment is supposed to be geared up for) lamps with no socket near by! Bathroom Extractor not working, lights that worked and then didn’t. No where to empty waste bins, the exterior waste carts were locked. This has the potential to be a super property, but it’s sadly lacking and expensive for what it is.","The apartment had 2 bedrooms and two bathrooms which is what we needed. And was a comfortable walking distance to the address we needed to be at each day, and the reason for our visit to Prague."

3518,original,Excellent value for the money,"A small tip for future guests, and it refers to the installation of holders in the shower cabin for soaps and shampoos and additional holders in the toilet itself.","Dear all,

first of all, I would like to thank you for your complete service and the speed of answering all our questions. The apartment impressed us in any case in terms of hygiene, comfort and location, and the important thing is that the apartment is located in a quiet area without noise and excellent connections with all localities in Prague.Also we were very happy that we had a parking spot. 
Everything was excellent and if we come to Prague again, we will definitely be your guests.

Best regards,

3487,original,,,"We were pleasantly surprised that the apartments completely corresponded to how they looked in the picture. Everything was very clean, shower facilities were provided for each guest. In the kitchen, you could find a lot of dishes and all the means for washing.

3477,original,,"The bathroom and the kitchen area is in really bad condition. The one wall next to bed has a falling paint on it. The room itself is on lowest floor in the inner courtyard of the house, so it is really dark inside. There were no dishwashing soap inside, the toilet paper was also limited.

2) worker entered the apartment in the morning to do smth with the door lock, but she didn’t knock, didn’t ring the bell, didn’t ask if we could enter. To be honest it was very unpleasant moment when someone is entering the apartment (like if it is their home) while you are just dressing up after the shower. It was totally inappropriate",All except points below was great
3465,original,,"Entry hallway smelled artificially parfumed, apartment also had strong chemical cleaning smell when we entered.","Clean and spacious apartment in a great location - Metro and tram super close, 15mins to old town. Can’t cook a gourmet meal there but essentials are there."

Clean and everything worked."
3453,original,We extended our stay. Moved to another terrific apartment in the building.,,Comfortable beds and pillows and a great shower with lots of hot water and good water pressure.
3450,original,Nice accommodation with some downsides,"Let me list all the negative points:
&gt; No real curtain in the bedroom with the large bathroom, only a transparent curtain.
&gt; One room has only a small bathroom (without shower), which is a bit difficult with 4 people, but you know beforehand. However, the smaller bathroom has NO mirror (even on request there was no mirror). In addition, there is only cold water in the small bathroom. 
&gt; The room with the smaller bathroom does not have its own door. The bathroom itself has a door, but this whole area has no door, so you don't really have your privacy. 
&gt; The one washbasin is nice, but due to the design, the entire facility is always wet. Speaking of storage, there is no good storage in either bathroom. 
&gt; The outside area is ok, but in a rather run down courtyard. The terrace is constantly full of bird feathers because there are always lots of birds there. 
&gt; In addition, right next to the terrace is the kitchen window of a restaurant, but this did not interfere with sleeping. 
&gt; There is only one small tea towel, which is not really a tea towel.
&gt; The support is keen and reacts quickly, but unfortunately our request was misunderstood: We wanted a proper curtain in the bedroom and we were told that there is no shower curtain. We also complained that there was no mirror in the smaller bathroom, to which the support said &quot;The smaller bathroom is just a toilet with a sink and the mirror was not even there&quot;.","The accommodation itself felt comfortable and safe. The furnishings are simple but stylish. The large bathroom is modern and has a nice shower. The outdoor area is practical, but you don't really feel comfortable due to the surroundings (see picture). 
The security doors are very good and stable, also the system with the numerical code for unlocking is useful and better than a key. The support is basically helpful, but this does not always lead to the desired goal."
3439,original,,"Entry hall had a nearly-constant smell of garbage or sewer gas. Could have just been service work in the area, so perhaps it was simply poor luck this trip. Not present anywhere else, so it's more of an observation than a complaint.

Shower stall floor was extremely slippery in use with no texturing, no shower mat for stability and no handles installed in case of slippage.",
3435,original,Thank you very much for your prompt assistance and clarification.,"1.It is too inconvenient to provide the key before all the passengers sign in.
2. Parking is available, but it's too inconvenient to use, so we have to find another parking space outside.",My favorite was the washing machine and the quiet accommodation.
3431,original,It was great. The apartment is in the heart of the city.,The WiFi didn’t work sometimes,"Location, self check in and check out, responsive staff, very clean"

3418,original,,"We felt a lack of that extra effort for the client, a quite &quot;formal&quot; and minimalistic attitude in service, maintanance and equipment: a few broken stuff, very little products (soaps, toilet paper, coffee) and formal &quot;no&quot; answers when we asked for something extra like an early check-in or extra matress (both which we accidently found possible later on). 
-It can get noisy, though mostly it's ok. -There is no air conditioning so windows must stay open. It can get hot in the rooms.
-Although there are 2 showers, there is only one toilet. It wasn't clear in the description I think","Tha apartment is spacios and location is super central&amp;convenient. The kitchen is quite comfortably equipped, there is a laundry machine and alot of natural light coming in. The staff was available and responding."

Thank you Michelle,we collect the first pair of keys from a lock box which was easy
3376,original,Absolutely NOT deluxe,"This is not deluxe by any stretch of the imagination. It's fully furnished from IKEA and trysk and the bed linen and pillows and mattress are super cheap and it really affected my sleep, the worst sleep I have had in 3 months according to my watch and this really affected our energy levels during the day. Very dusty and no attention to detail by the cleaners. The floors need a good mop too. The dining table is badly damaged. The furniture fabrics were dirty and no cushions on the sofa so not very comfortable. One of the chairs had a hole in the fabric.The wifi didn't work and it took a day to get it fixed. The shower head kept moving and spraying water everywhere so you had to mop after each shower. The toilet doesn't have a sink so you have to go to the shower room to wash your hands, not very hygienic. Oh and bring your own shampoo and shower gel, the one provided is awful. Some of the flooring is loose in the living space so mind your feet. You'll have a good laugh at the cheap frying pan as it spins round on the cooker though. Bird poop on the balcony when we arrived. But worst of all the instructions on how to get access were incorrect which started off the stay really badly and added in unnecessary stress.","The location was great, especially because the Artic Bakery underneath. Nice bright spacious accommodation. Nice balcony to sit out for your morning coffee."
3372,original,Very good Praha experience.,"I had a 10 day stay. I think it would have been good to have one sheet / towel change during my stay. I don’t think it is necessary to have a daily change and appreciated that I wasn’t disturbed by any room checks / cleans, but that one change would have made my stay perfect.",Good facilities. Good location. Easy access to building. Laundry very handy for my longer stay without any extra cost. Kitchen well equipped and glad for kettle &amp; toaster.
3366,original,,A bit of noise from the bar next door and the couch could be a bit better for longer term stays.,Great place for short term stays
3355,original,,"No AC and its on the top floor. Im summer, not a lot of air flow even with windows and balcony doors open. No blinds on the balcony door so as soon as the sun rises you are awake. Would be a lovely place for shoulder seasons when there is a breeze, or in winter.","Lovely fresh, clean, new apartment. Plenty of facilities - shower, washing machine, fridge, cooking essentials. Easy walk to sites."
3351,original,Memorable,"Pillows too soft and squashy for my taste.
Check out is set quite early and no storage facility within a kilometer, which is inconvenient in case of an afternoon flight.","The bathroom was new or refurbished, very clean and spacious. The shower and the drain worked properly which is not so common.
Fully furnished and functional kitchen uint, though we never really cooked - eating out in Pargue is an experience of its own.
Laundry and ironing in the basement - quite handy for longer stays like ours."
3348,original,"New apartment, good location, but insanely small. Door lock doesn’t work! Broken bathroom door","The high disappointment so far! 

Apartment is insanely small even for 3 adults and 1 child. 
the was problem with building lock! First 4 days you could go out but could not get into the building, because, someone from inside were always closing doors on lock from the inside, so the code would not work!I reported the problem and asked for the key instead of code, the answer was rude and unprofessional! They wrote a message in booking: “just push the door harder” 😠 they door was locked inside by someone, because we saw other people struggling with the building door! So if you want to stay in Prague and stay just in small apartments then you can stay with Prague days. If you want to walk and see the city, definitely not recommended.

We reported a problem that bathroom door is broken, it was impossible to close. They said that they will send someone. But then someone put the  door wrongly,  that there could be a chance that door would fell. So again we could not close the door.",Apartment is new

Thermostat was set very high and although smo came by to try to fix it it was set at 24-25 degrees.

Great value for quite an affordable price."
3218,original,Very comfortable stay!,Unfortunately you can hear the noise of the traffic (especially if you use living room as an additional bedroom). Also noisy refrigerator (quite loud at night). But these are just small improvement areas to be considered.,"Very nice apartment in a nice area of the city. In apartment we had everything what we need for the family, so noting really to complain about."

3171,original,,,"it was spacious, clean, comfortable and near good restaurants and coffee shops. it was very close to public transport."
3170,original,Just extremely disappointing around their security system and customer service. Had I not had internet or a my phone was,"I do not recommend this accommodation unless they have addressed the issues they have with their lock system/security. During my stay I needed to use a code to enter the building as well as my apartment. And there were more than one occasions where the code did not work as well as my battery to my apartment not working and not being able to access my apartment. 


Another terribly unsettling experience was that I came back home to find my apartment was unlocked and left opened by a staff member. No one told me that someone needed to come to check the battery of my lock and so the lack of communication on that was already an issue. Then to find my apartment left wide open while I was not there was extremely unsettling. And after asking the property about why this was their response lacked accountability as well as understanding around how dangerous this was. It was not until I experienced another issue my battery lock not working as well as not being able to get into the building that the property gave a more sincere response but this was after I had to share my grievances multiple times. I asked for alternative solutions like having a spare key and yet they gave me the wrong key and then told me they couldn’t give me the dead bolt key to my apartment. After sharing how difficult and disappointed everything had been I was offered a 10% discount but I truly would have just preferred to have cancelled with a full refund with all of those safety issues. 

Just extremely disappointing around their security system and customer service. Had I not had internet or a my phone was dead that would have left me in even more compromising positions and I would just hope that this property is keeping that in mind and thinking through better reliable solutions. As well as thinking through training around communication and safety for their guests if staff need to access our rooms. This is a fairly expensive accommodation and for these issues to happen it’s too disappointing.","Pretty quiet area and nice walkable green spaces near by. Walkable to a good amount of cafes, restaurants and grocery stores."
3169,original,"Comfortable , Good and everything was in my apartment","The toilet was little to high 😂,yeah….
But other things was good and well",
3154,original,Spiders and no cleaning between clients,"How to start... It was the most awful accommodation I ever stayed in. We got there at around 12AM, all good with the key - but when we got into the building a horrific smell - they keep the garbage inside, at the entry and in 4 night we spent there no one picked it up - you can imagine the smell :( Ok, then we found the door and entered the apartment and all looked kind of good, they bought some nice furniture but put it in an apartment that wasn't renovated or even cleaned when they rented it. Also, this building (not sure if all or a part of it) was a hostel and when I say they didn't put cleaned it, I think it has some signs on the doors and walls from that time. The even worse part came when we entered in the bedroom and in a few seconds 2 enormous spiders were climbing on the walls from the top of the bed. We found another on the curtains because after that we we're looking for them. The spider issue is not a new one as on the walls in Livingroom there were 2-3 marks of someone else killing spiders (one was even killed with the shoes). It was very late, but I sent a message to Prague Days mentioning the spiders and they responded in the morning, sending someone with a spray to kill the bugs. I hoped they did some cleaning as well, because you can tell they don't even vacuum between customers.
Also, in the shower there is - a hole probably - hidden with duck tape - like in a horror movie.
This was my experience, had to share it because all I can see here were good comments and this accommodation needs a renovation and improved cleaning services.","The guys from Prague Days we're very prompt and helpful.
The linen and towel smelled really nice and very clean."
3145,original,"Everything was great, would recommend",,"Everything was fine, the apartment was very clean, the place is also on a very quiet street, great for family stays"
3144,original,,,"Clean, friendly and responsive host company, quiet street"
3143,original,"Great place to stay, for families and couples",,"Clean apartment, great location, all necessary item present"
3140,original,Good AND bad location,"The place is right above a VERY busy street, very noisy at all times. As the windows are original, wooden type, even closing them does not help much. That's probably why they provide ear plugs, which is a nice gesture for sure.
A bigger issue is the NOISY air condition. It works normally, but every minute it makes a strong vibrating noise for a couple of seconds, making it impossible to sleep. THIS CONTINUES ABOUT 3 HOURS AFTER AC IS SWITCHED OFF, so plan accordingly. I contacted the landlord about it the first night, they responded promptly, promised an intervention (on a Sunday!), called before coming. We were back in the flat in 6 minutes. Spoiler: they never came.
The whole place is one big space, has NOT a separated bedroom.
The added sofa beds are not full length - I don't know if for adult guests a different type is provided. The green ones from the pictures are about 1.6 m long.
Some details might be fixed, the &quot;separating pannel&quot; is not fixed to anything and it is easily knocked down by a kid sleeping on the sofa. One nightstand is falling from the wall. The lightbulb in the bedlight is moving. Little things.","The room is in an attic of a historic building. Also the attic itself is historic, not a modern addition. The view from the small balcony is on the Prague castle. Being at the last floor (with lift) we never heard any noise from the neighbours.
The space is all renovated, the effort is visible. The bathroom is a little worn out, but functional. Cold/hot water without pression issues. Big fluffy towels, toileteries and earplugs provided.
The kitchen has full 4 spots stove and full electric oven. The fridge is a smaller type. We never used the kitchen so I am not sure about the equipment. There was also a coffee machine and some basic groceries, so before buying a pack of salt and a bottle of oil, check what is already there.
Wifi connection was quick and stable, one of us worked many hours daily and has no issue in 4 days and nights.
The location is right on the river bank, about 1 minute from a biiiig playing ground on Detsky ostrov, about 15 minutes walk from Charles bridge, and right on another bridge, in front of Dancing house. Tram stop of many lines is a 6 min walk. Plenty of food places around, from breakfast to dinner. Not sure about the nightlife, as many restaurants use common spaces of resident blocks so they close at 22. Overall the neighbourhood feels safe."
3134,original,It was good. Though definitely not the price worthy. I paid 400chf for 4 nights but the room and customer treatment was,"The stuff wasn’t around… I got some code and didn’t know more. Especially problematic though was that they send a mail that i can come into the room at the time I said I’ll arrive in Prague but check in was at 4pm. It confused me and the instructions where unclear, especially because the entry wasn’t even at the address they said…",The room was nice and cozy. It was clean and quiet. The entry to the building was 24/7 what made the stay much more feel like home.
3124,original,,"Apartment was not cleaned upon arrival (after 4 p.m.) but it was quickly fixed. No shadowing in the flat, so be prepared that you wake up when sun comes up.","Good location, nice view."

Staff very helpful.
Super Location in a quiet area of Prague."
3120,original,Nice location and luxury apartment,"The fifth floor apartment is acutely rented as a three bedroom apartment but it was only two bedrooms apartment with extra bed at the roof which is really not comfortable with a small bathroom which you can not staan to take shower.

I will not recommend the fifth floor because the fifth floor doesn’t have any window to see outside and it has small windows and very thin screens which is not enough to keep the room dark from the  sunlight specially in the morning when you wake up the sunlight is in your face. 

Shower had no hanger so it was not possible to hang the shower on the wall but you have to hold the shower with your hand which is really not comfortable to take shower .

There was no dishwasher in the kitchen and I did not  expect for such a nice kitchen and high quality of equipments no dishwasher .",Appartement is a luxury apartment in a very nice location and everything you need is really on waking distance and everything in the appartement is quality.

2979,original,Excellent apartment for a longer stay,"The bed was firm - cardboard firm. If you're  sensitive to neighbor noise, you might find the provided earplugs come in handy.

Lsstly, all the directional signage is identical - a bit disorienting. I tried, but never found the restaurant! 😅","Beautiful modern apartment, with everything you need for a longer stay. The kitchen was well-stocked and supplied, the room was immaculately clean, and the building also offered facilities for laundry, ironing, exercise, etc at no charge. Linens were high quality, furniture and outlets were thoughtfully chosen and placed (with plenty of storage)! The apartment windows are double-glazed, which keeps it cool and quiet (there was virtually zero street noise), and the bedroom is the furthest room from the hallway, which cuts down on nighttime disturbance from others coming/going. I did have one small maintenance issue (the batteries in the smoke detector beeping) but when I texted the maintenance manager, it was fixed within 15 minutes - stellar service! 

Be aware that the check-in process is entirely automated, and there are two different keycodes provided (for the building and the apartment) so you'll need to keep those with you - the building is a bit of a maze. But overall, access was easy enough, and I found it convenient to save the numbers in my phone instead of handling keys. The apartment was quite suitable for my needs, and a surprisingly pleasant experience. I would absolutely return, especially for a longer business stay."
2958,original,Fab location - couldn&#39;t be more central,Wasn't sure if we could handle the 3 flights of stairs each trip out but managed ok. Unfortunately we stayed when the football cup was on and the West ham visitors were singing all night in the square,Loved the location and the facilities. Great to be doing our own washing after a long holiday. The wifi was a fantastic addition we hadn't counted on.
2956,original,Poor checkin experience but lovely  property in a good location,"- the checkin experience was poor.  The checkin instructions that were on the Booking.com app were different from what we were meant to receive.  When we went to the Prague Days office there was nobody there except a number to call.  When we called them they said that the checkin instructions were  too complicated to give over the phone and would be on booking.com,  but they weren’t there.  In the end we found them in an email.  The instructions on booking.com only arrived the day before we left Prague.  I think the process relies too much on everyone’s phones and apps working perfectly even they are travelling, and lacks the human touch.

We arrived in the evening and had to look for a small lockbox with a key inside away from the property on a random place, which took us good 30 minutes walking around on a road with cars. I would really recommend the property to change the checkin process because it makes the arrival stressful. We booked this property because they advertised that the property has a garden. We had a baby with us and the weather was nice so we booked it to enjoy the garden but the garden was not usable at all. The grass was so high that you couldn’t step on it and it was even blocking access to the house and made it hard to get to the entrance door with a stroller. I asked the owner 3 times to please cut the grass but they didn’t do it. The property is down the hill and you have to go up the hill to get to cafes and shops, knowing I wouldn’t be able to enjoy the garden with my family I would have booked more central location instead.","Inside of the house everything is nice, nicely decorated and comfortable. It is spacious and clean. The staff is very communicative."

The building is on a big street, but the apartment is quiet, clean and has everything you need even for a long stay. The equipment is new, Wi-Fi is excellent. On a huge bed, with TV and streaming service, you can relax after a long day. I want to express my gratitude to all the staff. Fast, easy and correct communication with the owner. Decor is beautiful, apartment was lovely! I would absolutely return to the Sunlit Apartment in New Town by Prague Days, Prague. Prague is a beautiful city! I highly recommend this apartment."

2695,original,Great place to stay in Prague,just one small thing. for some reason on the address it led me to the wrong street. It was on the side street instead. Maybe it would be worth adding some additional info on the check-in process or some photos.,Everything was in great condition. having the code to get in was easier than having a card. Couple of minutes away from National Museum and most of the city centre
2684,original,Beatiful stay in a comfortable apartment right in the city centre,Came across some used kitchen utensils in cupboards.

We arrived before 19:00 and needed some help on how to find parking in the area, but nobody answered on the phone listed on the page from Booking. They do reply to messages via the Booking app, but that is not satisfying when the matter is urgent. Good to know for the future is that it is not easy finding parking in Prague, the zone had paid parking for a fee of 20 korona's/ hour.","I liked the apartment, the cleanliness in the apartment and in the neighbourhood. Good family market around the corner, and a small children play area in a green zone. We received good instructions on how to collect the keys.

2585,original,,"I ordered a flat with 2 single beds as shown in the picture. When we arrived there was a mix up and someone else had taken our flat instead and we were left with an appartment with a double bed. The staff didn't handle the situation well and even insisted that both flats were the same with double beds, which surely isn't the case.
In the end we did stay in the apartment with the double bed, which made us feel slightly uncomfortable.
Besides the bed situation the apartment was great and we enjoyed our stay.
Suggestions for improvement - besides the way they handled the above mentioned situation:
Install WiFi and a large mirror so that one can check how one looks.

Public transportations like (red line of) Metro C and Trams are easily accessible by walking distance less than 4 min. Cleaning is acceptable.
2548,original,"If everything had worked as it should from the start, we would have been quite happy with it.","On arrival it was overheated and not possible to regulate as the temperature controller had no batteries, also no instructions!

It was huge which we loved and was so clean. Really thoughtfully put together. FYI it needs a full length mirror that's all it's missing.
2495,original,I will probably come back to this apartment because It feels like home. I would like to live in apartment like this beca,"We had a problem with prking. It was written on Booking that we have a parking space waiting for us in the building, but an accident happened and we had to park our car at the Florenc parking which is 2.4 km from the apartment. They will cover the costs, but we certainly wasted energy and time on it. 

The front door of the building is very difficult to open. It can be seen that they are old which makes it difficult to unlock.
The neighbor helped us the first time, although she also struggled.

The upstairs bathroom has no door, only a toilet. Also, showering in the bathtub is inconvenient because there is no curtain or protection and the water splashes out of the tub.","First of all, the apartment looks beautiful. Everything is new and the style is minimalistic with wonderful artistic details. The Netflix on big TV was win win for us too!

There are two toilets, one downstairs and one upstairs, that's a great thing!

Staff were very nice with a lot of understanding and patience. We received detailed instructions and arranged everything through Booking. 

Location is quite solid. It took us 20 minutes walking to reach the Astronomical Clock, but the road to get there is beautiful, so the walk was pleasant. 
The street and surroundings are very clean and safe.

Tesco market is 3 minutes away and we bought food there for breakfast and dinner because the kitchen is very nicely equipped and we enjoyed preparing food."

2474,original,Lovely stay in the heart of Mala Strana,"You would expect for such a level of property to have someone to hand over the key. We had to take them from a key safe padlocked to a drainpipe outside the apartment on the footpath (the key safe is also quite stiff and can be difficult to open with freezing fingers, and the street is dark, cannot imagine if it was snowing as well).","Very spacious, elegant apartment in the heart of Mala Strana district.

My wife forget her expensive earring there and we informed the staff about it 30 minutes after checking out. We named the exact place in the apartment where the earring was left and asked permission to return and get it back, but the staff was completely unhelpful to organise it. 

Now I even have a suspicion that it was stolen by housekeeping or lost due to their negligence, but either way, it’s unacceptable — the staff behaved suspiciously. At first, they confirmed that they found the earring (they saw the photo of it) and promised to send it to us by courier but after two weeks they texted us that they did not find our earring but they found someone else’s gold earring. I found this coincidence unbelievable.",

Especially considering the low price and excellent location, overall a lovely stay and definitely would recommend!"
2418,original,Renovated apartment at convenient location.,None.,"We stayed at the apartment for 2 nights. Location at Michle district was very convenient for our trip to Prague. There is a parking zone at nearby street where non-local cars can be parked longterm for a small hour fee. All instructions to the apartment were communicated by booking chat without any issue. Apartment was at the top floor of the building without elevator, not a problem for a young couple. As we travelled in winter, apartment was cold after arrival, but we did not mind it a lot. However, radiators caused loud crackling noises when turned on for higher heating, so we settled for a little lower temperature. Presented pictures on the sites are definitely enhanced, but apartment did not disappoint us. Apartment was renovated with many amenities someone would require for a longer stay.

2308,original,,Would be great for someone to meet you at the apartment instead of going to reception which was a 10 minute walk away with suitcases. Hosts were great but we did have a situation where another guest had locked the main door to get inside the building therefore we was locked out for nearly 2 hours. Tried ringing the hosts for the first 30 minutes and no one answered but eventually spoke to them and we got inside the building. We asked how we would contact them if this happened again after closing hours which they said it’s not possible.

The sensor key to the outside door didn't work so I had to wait outside at night for 1.5 hours before someone arrived with a key to enable access to the building.  We had to make several phone calls before getting another key.  It is simply not good enough to be waiting on the street at night in a foreign city to get access to accommodation in a building you have paid for.,"The location was good for our purpose.

 Nobody knows what the buzzer # so someone has to go down to open the door.
I didnt like there is no lock in the shower, we had to inform the people travelling with us if we are to. Use shower.
I did not like there is no sink in the toilet.
Had to go either the kitchen or shower room to wash hands after using the toilet and after touching doors, knobs etc. 

The bed was not comfortable because the plats kept on moving when either myself or husband move or get up from the bed. 

Cleanliness of the unit was OK","The location was better than I expected. It is walking distance to everything and places I want to go.

Excellent location near the 2 metro stations and at the same time, not a touristic place. The district is beautiful and there are a lot of places to go and explore around. The room was not so big, but big enough. Everything required for cooking is in place (except an oven, keep in mind). The Internet is well enough for working. The host answered via WhatsApp and gave an entry code earlier than the arrival time."
2173,original,"Great location, clean and comfortable apartment, friendly staff, but layout didn’t work for us.","The only downside for us was the apartment layout. The two bedrooms are separated by a glass door, and it is impossible to get in/out of the “master” bedroom without going through the second bedroom. We had our kids in the second bedroom and my wife and I stayed in the master. whenever we needed to go to the bathroom, or even turn on the light in the master bedroom it would wake up our kids. I think this would be solved if the glass door was replaced by a solid door and a door was added between the master and the living room. if that was done it would be 10/10. current layout would work fine for a group not using the second bedroom.","Nice building, elevator is very useful. Location is great… restaurants, coffee shops, pubs all nearby and a grocery store right across the street. A nice park for children right outside the front door. Tram stop very close which goes straight to old town. Staff was very helpful and quick to respond before and during stay. Overall the apartment was very clean and well stocked for our stay. appreciated having the dishwasher and washing machine."
2169,original,It’s cosy  apartments with nice stuff inside for short staying.,"Place not comfortable for long staying. Nobody changes linens. 
no place to drying wet stuff, if you want to wash your clothes or towels. Also the timer with electricity. it was weird as everything switched off when nobody moved at the apartments nearly 15 min. so it was impossible to watch some move or work silent, as everything switched off and you have to stand up, walking a little and after again everything works. 
and actually not much friendly stuff. They have there a lot of different stuff room and also luggage storage but when I asked to keep my luggage for couple of hours they just said that no place. Later check out also was rejected. especially when originally check out at 12 pm they asked to leave apartments at 10am.","Very nice location. Easy to find, and very close to the metro. Just 30 min walking to the centre."
2163,original,Excellent Location,"Unfortunately the the inside of the main atrium and staircase was under renovation by a building company and we were not made aware of this. We were woken every single morning of our stay at around 7am with the plasterers mixing up plaster with their machinery and shouts to each other and grinding and drilling machines. A full size scaffolding also occupied the whole of the inside space of the staircase to facilitate this work along with all the builders materials. We were exhausted being woke up at 7am every morning and on the evening of our arrival our apartment was actually blocked by a scaffolding tower which we had to squeeze and crawl between to get inside our apartment.

The WiFi in the never really worked properly which was also a nuisance, so we couldn’t connect to the internet or watch even a movie on the TV as it also would not connect.

The apartment itself was very clean and comfortable. The kitchen area was clean and everything you needed, except the last occupants had boiled milk in the kettle, l assume for some fancy coffee,so we had to boil water in a pot to make our hot cup of coffee.

The location of the apartment itself is very central and that is the only reason we didn’t run out screaming HELP HELP !!! as so much broken sleep can get to you.

Oh and for some unknown reason there was no small kitchen table and 2 chairs to sit and eat your breakfast or snack at which was ridiculous as there is loads of room in the apartment.

There was a small round coffee table in the living room with 4 bockidy  / rocky legs which was useless and 2 back breaking stools you would find in a child’s play school.

I hope when the builders are finished there works and and the management have rectified these items have mentioned, then because of the location it would be just perfect.",Excellent location and everything we required in size for just the 3 of our family

2157,original,Closet to the train station and to the underground. central,It would be great if there were paper towel or napkins in the kitchen,Location and confort. Massage chair was a plus
2150,original,Great location but building works hugely effects the stay.,"We were informed of some building works but it did not show the extent of the building works! We thought we were trespassing because the building works were that severe. There were open wires, posts sticking out only covered by empty beer and water cans. The builders started at 8am making a huge noise, so you will NOT sleep beyond 8am. 
Moreover, the window on top of the door gives the builders full view of the kitchen and we made very awkward eye contact with them a few times. Being 3 young females, we felt very uncomfortable. When we complained, we received a 20% refund which did help.
There was also no window? But that’s not a huge issue haha.","Incredible location!! Only a 3 minute walk to the old town, it really is great! It’s very nicely decorated too :)

We had really tough task because we were by car and we arrived during Praga marathon. We were stuck for more than 1 hour and looking for place to stand with car because in Prague IT is difficult to stand on a place without living there. After an hour in which we tried to find space we called the reception with question : where we can find anything where we can stop our car without paying a fine, reception said that they can't help us and we need to show up in reception. Ok. We found parking lot which was ofc for money :D around 5km from the reception. After a walk to the reception we were shocked by the infornation we can not pay the rest of the price by cash. Only the same card we used earlier... Ok. Maybe such regulations or something. We asked also about the garage. Woman on the reception said everything is fine we will have parking space under the building. It was around 10PM when we finally achieved the hotel with keys. Guess what. We had the wrong keys :) we were waiting for ~ 20-30 minutes for any respond from the Hotel's reception, so we started to search another room because nobody was answering the phone in that time. Suddenly, after ~20-30 minutes somebody called and said sorry - the keys will be in 5 minutes BUT YOU HAVE TO STAY NEAR THE DOORS. I have to say that we did not have any place to stay near the hotel so we were still going around the hotel. The fun part was when the driver achieved the destination I get the keys and asked him how to open the garage Gate because we do not have the pilot. He responded he is the Uber driver :) so during next ~20 minutes we had to check on our hand how to open the garage Gate. 2nd 'funny' part was also that since the next day the hotel was acting like nothing happend.","The apartament is wide, bright and rrally pretty,
The localisation is amazing, but..."
2060,original,Nice quite location in Prague.,"Don’t judge the apartment by your first impression, photo attached, but it could use some work.  (Not owner’s fault).  There was no light at night, so it was hard to put the key into the door when entering at night, so a night light would help.  The water would fluctuate between hot and luke warm when taking a shower, not a deal breaker but be aware.","We liked the location, as it was within walking distance of many of the sites we wanted to visit and also the tram was close by.  It was in a quite area, which allowed us to relax after a busy day.  The apartment was well furnished and was very comfortable for two people.  Wi-Fi was very good during our four day stay."

Also, I informed them 3 times in advance (note while booking and then during a messanging and a phone call) that I will need an invoice. Now, 3 weeks after the payment was made by card, physically in their headquarters, I still do not have the invoice, they barely answer my phonecalls and do not seem to care at all.

We were promised an air conditioned apartment but were saddled with a noisy air cooler one which wasnt working.
The heat wave in Europe have us sleepless nights and we had to wake up early not to miss the expensive excursions we had booked during the day
On complaining for several days, we were messaged to very rudely by one of the staff Ms Jana . Please note they only respond by messages or you have to call them. They never came over even though we complained from day 1.
On the very last day we were given a fan which did very little to beat the heat.
They promised a refund of 20% which we didnt accept and demanded 75%. This 20% has also not come in. We demand Booking.com to intervene check the internal messages and help us with the refund we have demanded.

So I really recommend this place.",This apartment is located in a perfect place for discovering Praha. It is really near to Old Town and shopping area. There are many pubs and eating places in the same street. Apartment itself is beautiful and has many cool design items in interior.

1768,original,,"The cleaning can be improved. There was a lot of dark long hair in the living room. Both my friend and I are blondes, so the hair was not ours. We used the vacuum cleaner to extra clean the apparment and we also used the washing machine to wash the towels as they didn't smell clean. But the most annoying part is that there is no system for the windows. There is plenty of sun in the morning and no window blind to help with it. Also, for the terrace door, an insect net is needed as there are bees in the morning and bats in the evening. Early check-in and late check out are with additional cost.",The position of the apparment and the rooftop. The beds were comfortable and the furniture was quite new.
1767,original,,the bed was on a mezzanine floor and this was not made clear during booking. the sleeping area had a very low overhead and it just doesn’t make sense to have to climb up and down a flight of stairs to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night.,

1731,original,"The worstest apparent from Prague Days, that I lived","- check in not comfortable at all. It is was required to visit reception in another Prague district. Why I wasn't able to way by cart on Booking I don't know (previous apartments from Prague Days doesn't have such issues)
- instruction for self check in is not complete. It is was required 20 minutes to find a keys. During this period I had a phone call with guys from Prague Days and they even don't know the floor. They said me that apartment on 4 fl3, but it was on floor 6...
- After I check in, I would like to have a coffee. But coffee machine doesn't work. So I messaged to guys from Prague Days on Booking, but they just ignored me the whole week, while I was there (Previously they answered me in 2-3 hours) So in case you faced with any issues, don't wait that they'll help you.

There is no double bed but two single beds placed next to each other, which is quite uncomfortable for a couple.
You can get the keys from a reception that's around 15-20 mins from the flat.

.when you stay for the week , you expect enough   toilet papers, tablets for washing machine  and dishwasher as you have the facilities 
.furniture needs to be changed as they have chairs ready  to collapse, toilet seat broken, need also a new mattress. 
.they also needs proper pillow and spare with cover.
It would also be nice to have the facility to stay one hour extra without having to pay 16 eur","The location was perfect. Very central and during the covid ,we could walk everywhere from the place   Also very quiet. The size was also good for 2/3
Flat very warm during winter and water hot and good water power"

Recommend this to everyone who wants to stay comfortable in a city centre of Prague!"
1651,original,"Good price, location, facilities. Would definitly recommend.","The apartment we got was in a basement, one of the AC remotes turned out to be out of battery, and a few days in I noticed quite a bit of cobwebs around some parts of the ceiling. To be honest, none of these were deal-breakers, so I'd still recommend the place if you're visiting Prague with your family.","The host was very kind and helpful to us with all things related to self-check-in, explaining how parking in Prague works, etc. The apartment itself was overall great - got all the stuff you need and then some. The location is awesome too, the river's just around the block, and the old town is just about 1.5-2km away."

At 10 o’clock a lady opened the house door shouted on us to leave immediately we told her that the check out is 11 but she instead then she brought a man with her I told them that we are preparing our things to leave and when we made the booking it showed the check out time is 11
They send me a fine bill of 150 euro",

1629,original,Sadly a very disappointing experience for my first visit to Prague,"Checkin was terrible, keys need to be collected from city centre with no parking a long way from the apartment which isn’t ideal, but accepted. What is unacceptable is the office being closed when I got there the office was closed even though it was supposed to be open all day so could not get keys. No response to messages on booking.com from Prague Days though they said to contact them this way. Phoned many times, finally got keys. Roadworks had closed the main roads used to access the apartment, took 2 hours to find a route to park at the apartment finally. Again, many calls went unanswered by Prague Days as we tried to understand from them why we had such issues as we arranged car access As our main requirement in advance.  We lost an evening of our holiday to checkin issues, disappointing to say the least. No follow up from Prague Days during the rest of our stay other than a few generic emails and a request for a good review. I can not recommend this apartment or company, I would not use them again. The toilet leaked as well, but that seemed the least of our worries, the apartment was also rather basic, but just enough to get by if you spend little time there. Been using booking.com for years and this is my first bad company review, I hope it will be the last","The location was pretty good, I recommend this location, we booked this specific property as it offered parking. I wish I had read the full reviews before booking as the negatives outweigh the positives here unfortunately"
1622,original,,"The corridor leading to the apartment was creepy and like construction site. It was impossible to open the windows, so the apartment was a little stuffy. ","The location is the key feature of the apartment.  All major sights are within walking distance. The apartment has it's own yard serving as a parking spot for guests. It's spacious and bright. We were really surprised to find ice in the freezer :)
We had trouble starting our car and the staff were really helpful."

1232,original,,"The apartment was relatively small for 4 people. 
It seems that during the night the heat was turning off, therefore extra blankets/covers would be necessary for some people who need more warmth.
We asked for one of two separate beds, which didn't happen. We are not sure did the message got to the staff, as the check in, check out process went without the person involved.","The apartment is nice and very clean, nicely designed. It is very close to the centre and it has free parking spot.
The owner prepared a little guide how to get around the place, with recommended restaurants and places to go. It was very helpful and we used it couple of times."

Eventually, we understood that the mattress of the bed is of very poor quality, and we have had a pretty sour back.","It was, but since you have to go to another address to get the keys, it was not as convenient. It would have been better to have te check in in the same building. Other than that, check out was great because we left the keys on the table."
915,original,It was a comfortable stay in one of the best locations an apartment in prague could have.,The reception is located in a different place than the apartement. Finding two adresses of course should not be a major problem.But..when we arrived we found no bell for the name of the apartment or anything we could relate to the info we had. So I had to ask a shop owner next door who could open the main entrance to the building. The reception is there in the entrance hallway. The young lady then doing the check in really was not very friendly and did not seem to be intersted in being helpful to us. I had to ask for anything and it somehow seemed that otherwise she hardly would have spoken to us.So no warm welcome and far from my opinion about good service and helpful communication.That should be better if it is meant to go along with the standards the apartement itself has to offer.,The apartement was bigger than we thought.It has a nice living room with an integrated kitchen and the bed is comfortable . A big bathroom and an extra restroom etc.You really can live there..It is located on the5. floor in a beatiful apartement in Vinohrady. Best thing is the location itself.It is still quite close to the very center of prague and located in between zizkov and vinohrady wich are both exceptionally beatutiful and lovely places on their own.
914,original,"Very clean, great host, great location.",,
912,original,"Nice apartment, but very poor customer service.","Being accussed of pooping in the shower and trying to charge me 150 Euros for cleaning the waste trap which obviously had not been cleaned in a long time. A job which takes all of 5 mins to do and costs nothing.

They then tried to charge my card SIX times for different amounts without my permission.",Apartment is spacious and easy walking distance to the metro
908,original,Weekend stay ,Collecting the keys from an alternative location was a bit of a hassle but this was expected before we arrived and the check in point was only a 15 minute walk from the train station. ,Beautiful property. Great amenities. Would highly recommend to others!

They offered to book a taxi for us and messed up with the booking and the driver arrived nearly one hour late.",The apartment was nice and well furnished

The host company were very helpful and sorted out our issues promptly. 
"
862,original,"",One negative thing was the floor carpet. It was really dirty and needed to be cleaned or removed. ,Big apartments with two big bedrooms. Everything you need is in the apartment.
856,original,Good location but complicated...,"The driver we requested to pick us up from the airport appeared to be sick. We had to go to a separate location to pick up keys and there was confusion regarding the number of people on our reservation - they wanted to charge us extra to have someone come out and place more linens and towels to accommodate something we already had on our reservation. When we arrived at the property, it was already set up for 4 people. All that for nothing. They gave us keys and did not tell us which floor the property was on - guessing game to match the keys to the door. The kitchen was somewhat cramped. The only bathroom had a slanted ceiling making it difficult for anyone over 5 feet to stand up straight. The property is located on a high floor and was quite hot (visited in August) - the only cooling they had was 1 fan. ",The property had enough bed space and living area for our family of 4.  The location was excellent. 
855,original,nice experience in Prague,"it take me 20 minutes to find the room at night. there is a door at the stairs, so I didn't get to the 3.floor at first. And there is no room No. at the door, I miss the sticker of the door first, thanks for the help from the staff to tell me how to find it","good location, just a few minutes to the Charles Bridge and Old Town Square. The room is big enough for two people and very clean."
845,original,"Overall great, but unless you party all night and sleep during the day, bring good quality earplugs.","There's only one downside, but it may be crucial for some. It's VERY noisy during the night. The windows are facing the street and since the street is narrow, the acoustics are terrible. There's a strip club just 10 meters down the street and you hear constant noise from (mostly drunk) people gathering at the entry 'till small hours. Flocks of drunk teens come to and leave the central square up that street during all of the night. Garbage trucks come to collect waste from the nearby KFC at about 1AM, then the &quot;usual&quot; garbage truck comes at about 6AM. Unless you're absolutely wasted, you won't get any sleep there at night without earplugs.","The apartment is VERY spacious, comfortable and clean, has all what a family needs for a week's stay. The hosts are friendly and responsive. It's just around the corner from the central square of Prague (which is also its main downside, see further).
All of the Old City attractions and more are within 15 of walking. You have access to all three Metro lines within 3 minutes walk, as well as many tram lines. Real, 100% Prague center."
844,original,"Huge, comfy, furnished with careful, stylish design.",,"Since we checked in online before our arrival the picking up of the keys took really only a matter of seconds. From the moment of our booking throughout our stay there till our department we were provided with kind, helpful and excellent service by prague days, with a lot of useful tips. 
The apartment is huge, modern, furnished with careful, stylish design and cosy, comfortable furniture. The kitchen is provided with everything you might need during your stay there. It has its own free parking spot in the underground garage where you could park and leave your car, as we did, because finding parking place in the centre of Prague, could be quite tricky. 
But there are numerous trains just like within 200 metres from the apartment, a metro station about a 5 minutes walk, that take you to all the places of the usual tourist attractions. 
Prague is a truly, breathtakingly beautiful city, and we were absolutely blown away by it. Just as well we were by this stunning, sophisticated apartment, and would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone planning to visit Prague, to stay here."

Although a little daunted by the fact that we had to collect keys and check in at one location, then get to the apartment the staff were really helpful and arranged an airport transfer for us which made the process much easier.

We were fine with this as we are all good friends, but it is something that should be noted for anyone less easygoing! The bonus of the loft bedroom is that it faces the courtyard and is therefore very quiet and perfect for a good sleep. That said, we never found the pedestrian traffic or occasional car to be loud at all and it was fun to watch the vendors setting up their Christmas stalls right below us from the other rooms!","Omygosh the location and the view were amazing! Beds were super comfy and enough pillows for the 3 of us. Very quiet neighbours. We paid extra to meet and pick up keys at the apartment which was worth it.

We have to get a taxi to the reception in the city to pick up the key, the driver won't wait so we got to get another taxi back. The reception is on a busy road with no stopping/parking. Residents in the building were sick of guests like us that we confused about how to get the keys. They snapped at us.

It could be slightly cheaper, for the same price I might have gone to a hotel as my colleagues have done. The check-in office was quite far from the apartment.

Even tho it was booked in one name. So i would always dpuble check! Luckily we checked in ar 10 at night and the lady waited for us to walk back, otherwise we would habe had to wait until tomorrow. Also the experience of collecting the keys was a bit strange. 

The second apartment also smelt very damp in the bathroom, the noise of the club down stairs was very loud. We had to get some ear plugs to drown out the noise. 

We also got a transfer from the airport and the experience was not the best. On the way back we organised our own and it was much bettter.","Location, so easy to get to everything and surrounded by some lovely resturants and bars."
697,original,,"When we arrived at the chekin ( I was told the apartmnet is 20 minutes walk from there and not a 5 minute walk as I was lead to believe on the phone) we filled our forms and were told to come back at 4 p..m for the keys.
At 4 p.m we arrived but there were no keys, the receptionist told us there was a problem with the laundry and due to that the keys were delayed. She told us to go to the apartment ( 20 minutes walk) and wait there for the keys. ( why did they not email or call me in the first place to just go to apartment and not come to the check in again?? Such a waist of time). We arrived at the apartment, of course no one was there and we waited another 20 minutes only to get the keys but find out we have no linens, no bedding or towels. It took them more then two hours to bring them to the apartment and they just left them on the beds unmade. 
We were very disappointed by this treatment and I won't use this company ever again.
Also, the pictures of the house are very misleading on booking. It's not a two bedroom apartment, but five bedrooms, with other people living in the house as well. 
The bathroom is the tiniest bathroom I have ever seen, it's impossible to close the door because it's so tiny.
In conclusion find a different appartment, for 300 euros there are much better options",
695,original,"",The most I didnt like is just the toilet. Its way to small. Beware of the claustrophobians,Locotion was just awesome. 
690,original,This overpriced hostel is very uncomfortable in every way,"This apartment is in fact an overpriced hostel. The online description of this place is very misleading. We booked a two bedroom apartment with a private bathroom and a kitchen, but got two separate bedrooms on different floors (2nd and 3rd) and a toilet, located on the first floor. The toilet is the 2ftX2ft tiny and is open for use by all the people living in the hostel. The stairs are very unsafe and rickety. There is no closets or wardrobes in the bedrooms. The windows of the bedrooms overlook the trash cans of nearby restaurant. The place is very noisy overall. This is sad, but I can not find anything positive about this place except for the central location of the building.",The only thing to like is the location.

677,original,,"There's no information in booking.com telling me that I have to pickup the key in different location, as it written key can be collect at property.  The room is in the 3rd level and have no elevator to access so we have to use staircase and carry all our bags. Sometime the Wi-Fi is not available and the staff take along time to respond and not being  helpful to solve the problem. We had experience the electricity went off and there is no assistance at all to solve the problem,  their require us to wait till night.",
670,original,"","The room is much much smaller than what has been shown and stated online. It is definitely not 60 m sq. The room dimensions mentioned online are wrong.

652,original,"Dreadfully managed, to be avoided at all cost despite great location ","
I rarely had such a poor experience with terrible management practices, harassing me with emails and text messages constantly, turning a simple renting into a bureaucratic nightmare and a talent to make the simplest things utterly complicated. I’m not even sure in which category this place falls, Airbnb, hostel, appartement renting, although they pretend to behave like a hotel. Despite an overload of (mostly unhelpful) information, they did not disclose the place was in the same building as a low class noisy night club....Worse, the appartement was poorly maintained, stinky and under equipped. 
The staff looks ok though and it’s clearly a management and personality problem on the side of the owner or manager. ","Apart from the location, the experience was awful "
645,original,Well located flat with some areas to improve,"We travelled around 30 hours straight before arriving in Prague on Sunday afternoon. Disappointed to find just two small, thin and lumpy pillows provided. These were so bad we needed to sleep with the aeroplane neck rests and buy our own pillows on Monday.
While the flat was clean, the shower curtain had a yellow edge that made it look overdue for a change.
The cooktop is ceramic induction. None of the pots and pans are marked induction and some are aluminium. While we didn’t do a lot of cooking we learned from experience the cooktop simply won’t operate with non-magnetic metals like aluminium.","The apartment has a lot going for it. Right across the road from the National Theatre, one street back from the river and walking distance to just about everywhere. It’s a cosy size for two people and nice and quiet overnight. It’s got some fun character quirks too, like the old building lift, loo window to nowhere and bank vault lock on the front door.
Visitor experience could be improved with some clear info about the flat number and floor, because there’s only a small (easy to miss) sticker on the front door. We also had difficulty with the front door and balcony locks - a bit disconcerting when you can’t get back inside after dinner when it’s late and dark. Towels are small, thin and in short supply."

The ladies in the office forgot to give us the parking fob so we were required to pay for them to bring the fob to us.  Not a huge issue, and as this was the only hiccup, more of a learning experience.","We really loved the apartment.  Two floors, quiet, plenty of room and we spent most of our time, when in the apartment, on the balcony!  I think we may have turned on the TV once.  The view outside was better then any TV program."

490,original,All-in-all it was a pleasant stay (with some hiccups).,"The door to the bathroom was missing - this was really inconvenient, especially since the rooms also have no doors.
The keys to the building and appartment were not all working, so I almost got locked out one evening (luckily, I managed to sneak into the building along a neighbour).","The location of the appartment was really convenient and the steaks downstairs (in the Stejkarna steakhouse) were excellent.  The appartment is very well equipped, from coffee machine to entertainment equipment and washing facilities.  Bed - very comfortable.
The two young ladies (Vera and Tereza) taking the role of the hosts were really trying hard to cope with all the small (and not so small) issues arising during our stay, and to be generally helpful."
489,original,"Overpriced when compared to what you get (not central Prague location, very basic furnishing etc.)","The prebooked taxi (28 euro) never showed up at the airport, so had to take an ordinary taxi (46 euro). Keys had to be picked up in central Prague, quite far from the apartment. The apartment in itself was in a building with no elevator and this was not clear from the description. 84 steps up with a heavy suitcase is not for everyone. The furnishing of the apartment is also unusual: no couch or chair(s) to read or relax in, only two large pillows on the floor. Very small dining table and two plastic folding chairs. The bed is on a ledge with no railing. Large double bed, but the mattress is very hard. A quite steep staircase leads up to the ledge and because of the ceiling you practically have to crawl in from the stairs to ledge, and you bump your head onto the ceiling all the time because there is not standing height on the ledge. The balcony is full of planters with old soil and no plants - not very inviting.",Nice and quiet neighbourhood. Modern apartment with new kitchen and bathroom. Very clean apartment.

3. There are stairs to climb to get to the apartment. 

4. The entrance to the building and the way to the apartment smells very disgusting, since there is a place for garbage collection in there and the smell reaches inside the apartment which is not what we are expecting.


5. Wifi is not working at all.

6. The apartment is not cleaned very well, I have requested before coming that they take cleanness very seriously, however, you can see black marks on the bottom of your feet from just walking from the bed to the bathroom. The stovetop, refrigerator, and many things are not cleaned well.

465,original,The apartment is nothing like the online pictures. The agency manager is unhelpful and abusive.,"When we arrived the apartment was clean but in genuine need of refurbishment: 
•	Internal cupboards &amp; fixtures haven’t been painted for at least 40 years.
•	IKEA kitchen poorly equipped, badly designed e.g. corner sink inaccessible and awkward to use, no draining board, wooden bench top is waterlogged falling apart &amp; leaky
•	at night the flat is dark, gloomy and depressing. Lighting is inadequate.
•	light fittings haven't been secured properly to the ceiling and look like a potential fire hazard.
•	curtains are too small for the windows meaning there is no privacy at night from the flats over the road.
•	rotten window frames. 
•	external double glazed windows are broken providing no sound insulation.
•	hostile neighbours create trouble if you use a laptop for Netflix night curfew is 10.00pm.
The noise from the trams is very loud so be prepared for an early morning call around 5.00am when their frequency starts to pick up: they don't stop at night. 
The worst was the beds (the cheapest IKEA produce) and really uncomfortable. Broken slats in the base left a hole in one bed almost a metre wide through which the mattress was falling making it impossible to sleep on. Mattresses were old, stained and worn out.
We complained about the broken bed and matrass and after 5 days agency delivered a filthy, heavily worn and possibly flea infested replacement mattress which looked as if it had been recovered from a rubbish tip. We refused to have it in the flat because it was a health hazard. We were then threatened and harassed by the agency who refused to remove it. Eventually the manager said that our complaints were unreasonable, and the quality of matrass is acceptable by Czech standards.

In the flat, hitting was shut off, even if outside was 5 degrees, and the host did not know how to put on the hitting. I had to study myself the system, it was not an easy stuff.

İt was very difficult to find the room in a big circle buuolding complex. Lost 2 hours for it..",Good location
252,original,"","This is the worst service ever. When I booked a room, I was asked what time I was most comfortable to check in. I indicated the time but I was settled 2 hours later than I requested. At the same time I had to look for parking at this time. When I wanted to pay118 euros (as indicated in my booking) I was charged a commission of 25 euros. About the fact that I need parking, they forgot. When I asked for a late check-out, they asked what time I wanted to leave, I found out the time, then the administration replied that I could not leave later. Relationships on the reception are dreadful.",
251,original,Great place in the heart of Prague ,"The pick up of the keys is a bit awkward. Having to go into the town, busy road, no parking is a bit annoying. The key pick up and apt are 2km away from each other. Just small point. ","The location is excellent

249,original,"",,2 minute walk from Malostranská station and Charles Bridge. Good location as it’s very quiet as well! 
248,original,,"Coffee cups left dirty in the sink, while the reception told us that we cannot check in early as we had to wait for the cleaning staff to finish.....",
247,original,Good location,The toilet didn't work for our entire stay. We reported this on the first night and it was on the final (5th) night a plumber was sent at 7pm to fix it. A handyman was supposed to show up and arrived at different times. Not impressed. We received a $30 refund. I would never stay here again.,Location was great. Kitchen had everything we needed.
236,original,Basic apartman in a superb location.,"We musted wait for the key's befor the properity a half hour even though that we wrote 3x our check in time for the manager and for the guy how gived us the key's. (last time 1 hour befor our arrival and all our messeges was confirmed)

The guy took with 120 CZK more money from our card, like was the complet price on booking.com.

The apartman was VERY COLD 13 'C (out side temperature was the same!!! ) and the guy can't turn on the heating!  Forrtunedly I'm also from east europe and enought old to turn on that old gas-radiator. 
In the apartman was only 1 radiator. Kitchen and bathroom are without heating!  We leaved open the door's but in the bathroom was all time cold even thought the 2 day's heating!

They take extra 50 € for the cleaning, is it 2-3x more like the other apartman's in the same locatin, but the shower was disgusting and the most moldyed what I have been see in my life !
The cleaning was very skean-deep. Thick dust, old spider's web's, dirty windows...

The kitchen is well equipped, but neede some cutting knife, cutting board, a dish rag too.","Location, free privat parking."
235,original,"","They are real scammers. Tried to charge my card after checking out, without even messaging me about any issues. Also they havent paid the internet bills, so there was no wifi during my stay.",
234,original,,,"Nice loft in quiet building, accessible by elevator. Perfect communication with the host."
231,original,,"When checking into the apartment there is no representative from Prague Days (you get the keys to the apartment in the center of Prague 1, then you go to the apartment and the settler yourself). In connection with this circumstance, I highly recommend to very carefully check the condition of the apartment and any faults found, something damaged and others, prepare a report with photos and send it to Prague Days so that after departure you don’t run into problems and don’t pay a fine for did not commit.
The apartment is not clean enough, not very clean carpets, dust in the corners, strange hair in the bathroom, very dirty ventilation filter in the bathroom on the second floor.
Squeaky bed in the bedroom on the first floor.
No soundproofing from neighboring apartments, voices from neighboring apartments are heard.

It would be better if the representatives of Prague Days were present at the check-in and check-out of the guests from the apartments and handed over the keys in the apartments.","Convenient location from all major attractions, apartments are located in a quiet area, close to many cafes, restaurants, a larger supermarket Albert.
There is a park nearby.
There are available a lot of different kitchen equipment."
227,original,Could be Luxurious ,"Broken blinds, so no privacy and not much sleep , inadequate air conditioning, no iron and ironing board, no microwave, no coffee machine, no toaster. ",We were happy with the location and having two bathrooms and a cloakroom. The furniture was comfortable. 
226,original,Agradable,,El apartamento en general
220,original,Clean; roomy; close to restaurants &amp; the tram for easy transportation.  A perfect choice to stay in.,The elevator was out of commission for 2 of our 4 day stay; on a weekend - these things happen; but it was a bit of a walk up the stairs.,"The loft at Zizkov was perfect; it was extremely clean; beds were comfortable (even the sofa bed); we had 3 bathrooms!!!, a dishwasher &amp; washing machine; and ample space for 4 people.  So easy to access the tram -- we were 10 minutes from old town!  The building &amp; street were beautiful; elegant style.  There was a small grocery store less than a block away and tons of restaurants close by.  It was an ideal location.  The telecommunications tower was a perfect landmark.  We were met at the loft to book us in when it suited us.   I booked the loft &amp; was quite proud of my accomplishment -- it was a hit!!"
209,original,"","receptionist, problems and bed assistence form owner",ecxellent apartament new and clean
208,original,recommendable,Please consider upgrading the bedding.,"Well equipped, great location. Very recommendable for couples !"
192,original,"It suited it&#39;s purpose but not what we were expecting, caters more for big groups with cheap budget.","We had to go to another office to pick up keys and check in. Not only was it further from the airport but it was 15mins walk (20 mins+ when you're lugging luggage across paved roads and foot paths) away from the accommodation. Was very inconvenient especially after a long flight. 

We also had to fill in more paperwork and information when we were checking in. Every other place we checked in to, only required our passports and basic info. It was almost like we were filling out a lease form, which was what the lady at the office referred it as. 

While the space is big, it is more suitable for groups and big families, not idea for couples. For the same price we could have got a more luxurious smaller space (we definitely didn't need all that space for 2 people) rather than a big budget space with no use for it. From the property description we did not realise it was catered more for groups with numerous wooden pallets and mattresses piled up in the living room. We only used the main bedroom which had a queen bed, it was just weird to see the pallets and mattresses piled there in the living room and the bathroom was inconvenient to get to because it was at the other end of the apartment. 

As mentioned not idea for a couple to stay. But very large and spacious for a big group travelling on a budget. We paid the same for 2 as for 10 so no value for us there.",Very big spacious space suitable for big groups not so much couples
188,original,"",The apartment can have air conditioner! ,Almost everything! 
186,original,Interesting stay,"Having never been to Prague we didnt know that we really couldnt drive to the property to drop off the luggage.  We tried which was a huge mistake!  When i asked at checkin they said we could dive there to stop long enough to unload the car. That was not possible with the number of people and the narrow streets.  The
apartment was in a great location but was also very loud at night with the people partying in the streets and with no air conditioning we neded to keep the windows open.  Be prepared for noise which was worse on Thursday night (stayed Tues-Fri). Did not stay over the weekend but assume they would be worse","Apartment was close to everything, clean and was very spacious."
185,original,"the location was great, the apartment is stupidly big consider its in the heart of the old town :)",,"the quick, helpful and thoughtful response from the receptions, especially during my trouble when i left my keys inside the apartment, the fast response from the locksmith makes life easier"

171,original,Stay was great but the reception and keys handling was extremely poor,"The collection of keys are really bad and inconvenient.  Booking.com did not provide information on keys are located in a totally different places than the apartment when we booked.  Once arrived at the location, there is no clear information on how to open the locked door to the reception.  In the reception, the front desk were badly informed of the full amount we had already paid and worst, they were not able to tell us which floor the apartment is located, despite being asked 3 time, but kept saying they would send us email!  We told them our data connection was block with no email access, and they still refused to tell us the location of apartment.  We arrived at the apartment building, with no clue on which door to open, called the reception who had no clue on which apartment we should go to, but instructed us to try the keys at different doors (other people's residence)???!!!  This is by far the worst reception and key collection experience I have ever had.","The apartment is great, looks exactly like the pictures."
169,original,Very pleasant,The apartment was on the third floor which could be a problem for some people,"The location was amazing, two minutes walk from old town square. The rooms were very spacious and apartment was homey!"
168,original,Excellent time was had and the accommodation was clean and in an excellent location .,The only difficulty was it proved difficult to unlock the actual door to the apartment and the key and lock mechanism could be better . Once we got the hang of the type of lock we had fewer problems .,"If you book a taxi from the airport you will be taken to central office to collect the keys and then the taxi will drop you off as close to the entrance as possible . 
ThE apartment was lovely and very clean , modern and very handy to the old,town centre. 
We,would,definitely stay again .  Thank you"
153,original,,"I was travelling with baby &amp; its pram. The apartment was on 3rd floor which i never knew so i had to drag luggage, grocery and pram daily many times. No toiletries were provided but the host refund me few euros at the end of the stay. Taxis can only reach 500m away. We stayed in August as it was very hot. There were only two small standing fan which were working but was of no help because of which i had sweating night sleep.","Location was in the middle of old town, walking access to Old town square.

Very fast feedback on emails.
Also owner organized contact with us! 
Bedrooms are comfortable, room design is nice and colorful.
Good place for eating on 1 place the same building."
125,original,Prague was magical and will surely return for another stay.,shower and bathroom too small for a family of four.,"Loved the place, with great location and 2 minutes to the tram, 5 minutes to the castle. Very ideal with the kitchen equipped for a family and even basic items like sugar, tea, oil and a few pods for the coffee machine.  Ample towels and also sheets.  Would have preferred to have been given an apartment with a bigger shower."
113,original,,"Bathroom: unexpectedly small! Looks much bigger in the photographs. So you'll be suprised if travelling with four people. Contains toilet and shower. Ventilation system doesn't work and there is no window. 
Shower: Warm water only for about a minute. The seal on the floor isn't watertight! You'll end up with water all over the bathroom floor which is a nuisance if you want to use the toilet.
All of these can be repaired. So maybe this account is obsolete in a month or less.","Location: close to many sights and opposite a zabka discount. Old town is within walking distance. Parking in front of the buildung (with extra costs).
Clean bedsheets."

106,original,,"In the bathroom is broken shower door and faltering part of the door is replaced by a shower curtain attached to a rubber. On the bathroom window  is missing a curtain and that’s why  you have no private sphere in the bathroom, especially in the evening when the light is on. Apartment is also very dusty.
Keys of the apartment you have to pick up in another part of Prague. This could be a problem, if you are traveling with a lot of luggage.","Excellent Location, kitchen is full equipped , size of the room, easy communication with property owner, sympathetic lady in the check in office

88,original,Fantastic place with really nice people.,Nothing,The rooms
84,original,,"We disliked that we had to go by two trains to get the keys. 
Also when we came there was a woman who had to clean the apartment. She was there at our arrival and she was EATING. And when we asked her to do everything faster, because we were exalted after the flight. She became angry and pissed off and started to throw the vacuum cleaner.","The apartment was good but far away from the photos. It was comfortable.

It will be great that the key collecting point should be somewhere close to the apartment in the future. It was very exhausting to go up to 5th floor together with a baby and the pram to be carried up and down whenever we go out, it wasn't pleasant at all. Our neighbours in B-apartment were quite noisy. TV channels didn't work at all.","My family loved the apartment right from the 1st minute. Beds were very comfy. I would give 10 points to the housekeeper, the apartment was very neat. Information in the apartment was very useful as well as the information via email. I love the fact that the host was corresponding actively. Wi-Fi was up and running.

A quick call to the landlord also led to immediate success and the accommodation can therefore be highly recommended. Thank you.",,,"Many thanks for a lovely flat, the prompt help with the door (battery flat) and the tips. The TV and Wi-Fi didn't work properly from time to time, but that wasn't important to us."

25254,translation,"Nice, well-equipped flat (except for the air-conditioning, which sometimes leaked to the point of accumulating 1 inch of water in a bucket). We had to wipe the floor every day when we returned. It's a pity this defect wasn't corrected before we rented, because you could see from the swollen paint on the ceiling around the air conditioner that this wasn't the first time it had leaked. Not to mention the fact that 5 minutes after noticing our rental error on AirBnB, the Prague Days company refused to cancel the reservation. AirBnB compensated us slightly by offering a meagre compensation of $80 on a future rental. In short, it's a shame about all this history when we've been customers for more than 10 years.  Finally, the apartment was well located, right next to the canal, lined with large trees that were very pleasant for walks and stops at the terraces. Close to public transport, so easy to visit places of interest (old town, Prague Castle, Charles Bridge, etc).",,,"The air conditioning sometimes leaked so much that 1 inch of water accumulated in a bucket, and sometimes even in 2 buckets. We had to wipe the floor every day when we returned. This defect would definitely have to be corrected before the next rental, because you could see from the swollen paint on the ceiling around the air conditioner that this wasn't the first time it had leaked. Not to mention that 5 minutes after noticing our rental error on AirBnB, your company Prague Days never wanted to cancel the reservation. This shows a lack of judgement, professionalism and ethics. We will never again rent an apartment managed by Prague Days."

25249,original,Great place to stay. Only downside is that the air conditioning is very loud so hopefully you like white noise whilst you sleep or don’t mind the heat.

Bonne continuation!"
25245,original,"We enjoyed our stay! 
The apartment looked nice and clean. It’s quite close to the tram stops, so it’s easy to get to the city center. The TV also had a few streaming services like Netflix available, so that was a pleasant surprise. We did face a few issues: we didn’t have any towels when we checked in, so that was very inconvenient, but the host was able to resolve it pretty quickly. Another issue was that the stove did not work properly, always turning on and off, so we had to use the oven instead. The balcony area is also shared with another apartment, so that’s something to keep in mind. Overall, the place is great!",,,
25244,translation,"The inside of the house was very old, dirty. You can hear the creaking of wood while walking on the floor. They wanted to compensate us for the prague days that left the broken door handle in ruins. The old age of the house should be thought-provoking in this context. The location was quite good.",,,

1. the instructions to get in were not that clear in English, but worked. I think the key item is to explain the lift and apartment entries are half a level seperated 
2. we ran out of toilet paper so I took additional from your supply
3. there was a not to pay for bars coded items... but I found none

Washer machine was bit difficult to figure out given it’s in a different language

The pillows for the bed need to be better, they were so flat like nothing to them. 

Everything else was AMAZING! You are the best host we have ever had! We appreciate everything!"
25237,original,"We met up with friends in Prague and had a great stay here! We used the kitchen, dishwasher, and washing machine, which helped us feel right at home. The unit is walkable to several tourist parts of town. The unit did not have AC so we used the fans provided and opened up windows to keep cool. We note that the listing states there is no AC so we knew this going in. Also, while there was street noise from the bar across the street, we were able to use a noise machine and earplugs to reduce the noise. Overall, a great stay and a responsive host made for a great weekend vacation!",,,

apartment. It was very hot when we were there and the apartment has no AC, but we knew that already. We searched for accommodation with a lift as we have a guy in a wheelchair and were a bit surprised when we realised that there was a staircase up to the lift. Maybe we missed that information or it is missing, luckily our guy can walk a little with help so we solved it anyway.

Regardless, we thought that the apartment matched the description well and that it was a perfect location for us to explore Prague. Thanks for a great stay!",,,Thanks for a great stay !

25227,original,"We had a great time, the communication was very very easy - questions got answered pretty quickly. 

Furtniture (and overall appartement) was pretty new.

City is in walkable distance (although not a short walk and a lot of stairs). 

Great to have an Elevator, AC was needed during the summer days.",,,

To make your stay even more pleasant, I would like to ask you to fix some deficiencies in the hot water supply and equipment in the apartment, which I have already reported in advance.

25216,translation,The accommodation corresponded to the description and photo. Everything was at the highest level. I can and will recommend this apartment and the owner to my friends. I will be happy to stay in this apartment again. Thank you for your hospitality,,,
25215,translation,This is a clean new property in a great location.  The old town was only a 5 minute taxi ride away. There was a Lidl nearby so it was easy to get what we needed.,,,"It was a little hot in the summer, and if it had air conditioning, it would be the perfect place.
The car park access could be improved, as the system of first finding the house keys, going up to the house, then grabbing the garage remote and coming back down to park makes me feel anxious and uncomfortable."
25214,translation,"The flat is well located and within walking distance of the town centre.
It is located in a beautiful old building with a very nice entrance.
We were able to leave an hour later, which is great when you're travelling with a 10-month-old baby.
However, the flat is very noisy, the wooden floors creak a lot and you can hear a lot of noise from the street and neighbouring flats.
What ""s more, the curtains don ""t block out the light.",,,"To improve, double-glazing should be installed and the curtains changed to make the rooms dark."
25213,original,"This was an excellent place to stay - the apartment is exactly as the photos show and the view from the terrace is incredible. 

A very big open plan space with A/C and tv, very clean with really comfortable beds. Location is very walkable to all the major sites in Prague, but not so central you can’t have a bit of peace and quiet on the top floor of the building. There is also a lift to help with your luggage! 

Recommendations left on the information booklet in the apartment were brilliant and helped us to choose where to go/eat. Location is also relatively near to a large shopping centre which is great for getting snacks/other food when you’re not eating out - you don’t have to go far! 

The hosts were very responsive and flexible, allowing early check in and late check out which was really helpful for us, and actually checking into the apartment was very easy. 

Overall excellent value for money and would absolutely recommend to anyone staying in Prague!",,,"As written in my public review, this apartment was excellent, and we all really enjoyed our stay there! 

Perhaps one thing which we noticed could be improved upon would be the AC - when on during the day it occasionally makes a short buzzing noise every 5-10 minutes. While this is fine and not noticeable during the day, at night it can be a little distracting. Similarly with the fan, while good in the day the noise is a bit too loud at night to also be on then. I wonder if the AC needs checking on at all? 

But still overall a brilliant experience as this is literally the only thing we could think of that might need improving! 
Thank you! :)"

Nous avons beaucoup apprécié les petits détails sur notre lit à notre arrivée (bouchons oreilles, masque de nuit).

Le logement est securisé et à proximité d'une ligne de tram qui nous amène en moins de 10 min au centre de Prague. Les instructions de Check-in et out sont très claires ce qui a facilité notre arrivée autonome.

Proche d'un magasin Lidl et grand frigo pour y stocker de la nourriture. La présence du ventilateur fut un réel plus vu la canicule ! 

Nous avons vraiment été très satisfait de ce logement et avons passé un excellent séjour ! 
Hôtes très reactifs aux messages ! 
Merci beaucoup ! ❤️

Kelly & Thomas",,,"Hello,

We really enjoyed our stay in your accommodation. Everything was very clean and well taken care of!
The only small improvements we would suggest are providing a little dish soap and a hand towel in the toilet, and mentioning during check-in that the chip doesn’t work and that the key should be used instead.
Apart from that, everything was truly perfect!

Thank you for trusting us and for being so responsive to our requests ! 

Best regards,

 cotton beed sheets would have been better. The polyester (or other Synthetic)  bedsheets are very warm to sleep on in Summer even with open Windows... And the pants... They just take space. Hotels don't have them for a reason, they attract insects.

I made it a private Feedback, cause you can Charge that if you want.

25204,original,"Really clean and neat place. They have Netflix, Prime video newrly everything on the television.

The desk for working is super nice and comfortable. I would definitelly go again. Maybe the internet when it comes to streaming uploading video is a bit slow, but its very much useable, unleas you are going to high demand stream.

Overall would definitelly recommend, they are super responsive, they even brought us a new towel color as we requested.
Location wise theres Gym close by and grocery shop. If you are interestef we went to Space Gymm as private gym late night session. 🙏🙏.

Also the small courtyard offers the possibility to drink the first coffee in the morning outside in the sun :)",,,"We felt at home.
Two things we would have been happy about.

The location itself is outside of the old town but in a really great neighbourhood with lots of local cafés restaurants and amazing architecture. The apartment itself is very spacious clean and comfortable. Some things to know is that there is no AC and it’s hard to leave the windows open if you’re sensitive to noise while we were there there was construction happening next door as well as across the street which made some of the trip, frustrating. The owners did acknowledge our frustration and assisted us a little bit with the situation I suggest asking before booking if there is any construction happening in the apartments so that you can have a pleasant day otherwise I think everything was great and that apartment is very nice.",,,
25197,translation,"The accommodation was as described, very nice in a quiet area. Parking in the garage is also possible.

25185,original,"Great flat in the middle of the  lively and trendy Holesovice neighbourhood with many cafés and shops.

Kitchen has everything you need, Wi-Fi worked fine. And the terrace is a huge plus. Can get warm in summer, but there is air conditioning in the flat, and it has windows to three sides, you can easily cool it down in the evening. It is definitely one of the nicest flats I have ever stayed in, and I've stayed in a few! Only slightly negative point was a strange smell in the bathroom, I suppose it's due to the old house. And yes, the renovation in the house is still ongoing, there are cables hanging out anywhere in the hallways, but the flat is fine.",,,"Nothing to add, it was a great stay!"
25184,translation,"The accommodation was fine. Everything was ready for summer days.

In case you want to improve your check instructions, it might be easier for guest if you update your check in instructions to this:
-to park, you will need to fully open the doors on the street and the other set inside to drive the car through and then shut the doors behind you. 
- to get to the apartment, you go up a few stairs and then 2 full flights of stairs (a few stairs to get to the ground floor > full flight to get to the 2nd floor > full flight of stairs to get to the 3rd floor where apt is), and then on the right you see the door which leads to the front door of the actual apartment.

25175,original,"Located on the North Bank in Prague 7, a 20 min walk to the old town, via a great Beer Garden in the park! Lots of restaurants and shops, our favourites, Cafe Cruz & Bahn Mi, next door a bakery and Billa is close. Parking is difficult & expensive in the surrounding streets. You can leave the car at Horakove for 700z/day, just a 7min walk. There are many parking options around the Holesovice Metro. We parked at the P&R, which is free on Sat/Sun, so we only paid 100z (€4) from Friday 4pm until Monday 12 noon. (20min walk). Mon-Fri, more expensive, only 1st 24hrs cheap (100z), then you have to move or pay per hour after that. Fizz car park 250z/day MR.PARKIT.
Apart: Great coms, key box & fob entrance, 6th fl with lift, newly refurbished to a high standard. Great balcony, well equipped kitchen and comfy bed. WIFI & A/C´s worked well, skylight in the bedroom very annoying, the sun hits you in the face at 5.30am. We blocked it with paper, couldn´t find a cover/screen. Highly recommended!",,,"Would suggest you have a cover made for the skylight in the bedroom. 
An awning for the balcony would also be great, the sun hits it directly in the morning!

We mainly used it for bathing and sleeping since we were out and about every day.,,,"Coming from the US it was a little bit challenging to shower without a shower curtain/door.  I had to use the mop to dry the floor every day.  A set of instructions for the washer (in English) would have been helpful, I eventually figured out how to use it.  The floor fan was much appreciated."
25171,original,"We had a wonderful two-week stay here during our time in Prague. The apartment was clean, comfortable, and in a fantastic neighborhood—quiet and local, yet just a short walk to the metro for easy access to the city center. There were great restaurants, cafés, and shops nearby, which made settling in feel effortless.

Traveling with a baby can be challenging, but the hosts were incredibly accommodating and made sure we had everything we needed. Communication was fast and helpful throughout our stay. It truly felt like a home away from home, and we’d gladly stay here again next time we’re in Prague!",,,"We really enjoyed our stay. Thank you for being accommodating with our baby and early check in. here are just a couple notes:

I wish there was a little more coffee, toilet paper, and paper towel stocked for our two week stay.

The laundry dryer accumulated water and that was not something we were used to, so having a heads up about that feature would've been nice.

Also, the main bathroom shower didn't drain well and the internet seemed to go in and out quite frequently. 

Cheers,
Dan"
25170,original,"This apartment felt like home! We enjoyed the quiet surroundings and cozy living room. 
The location was perfect, within walking distance of the Petrin Gardens and plenty of restaurants around the area. 
The communication with the host was excellent and they fixed the internet issue we had on the first day. 
Thanks!",,,"Thank you for hosting us!  We loved the apartment and enjoyed our time there.

We wanted to let you know about a few minor issues:

- The mattress was very comfortable however, the pillows were terrible! We both had neck pain after the second day. 

- Also, when we stayed at other Airbnb’s they have Olive oil and other spices for cooking and we had to buy our own in this occasion.

The internet connection kept malfunctioning so I just gave up and did not work from the apartment.

25159,original,Great flat… dosent feel like a studio with the separate bedroom. Decent location with 2 supermarkets close by… really quiet even with the windows open at night. We had a great stay,,,Hank you guys!!! It was lovely
25158,original,"Everything was not bad. Positives was the bed was comfy, good location, spacious. Negatives were there was a coffee maker but they were ""phasing out"" the coffee, they said. So for a five day stay with two people there were three coffee pods. All when I was expecting coffee since that was the description. Also, they said they would provide washer sheets for laundry but it was a wild goose chase as to where these were. It ended up there were none.  We ended up having to search for detergent and buy our own.  Their iron ruined my favorite shirt. I ironed it as I had a million times and their iron burnt a hole in it. I mentioned this to the hosts and they did not acknowledge my grievance. Main room curtains do not close at all so there's lack of privacy there. At night, the room is open to all of the other buildings so act with discrepancy.  I would not stay here again.",,,"Hey guys - just like I said - if you show coffee - do you really expect guests to arrive don't then have to go out and shop for pods? And for detergent and dishwasher soap? C'mon 

No microwave isn't ideal. Oven isn't the same. Ignored about my favorite and expensive shirt being melted by the iron. 

I wish you well but these little things would make a big difference!"
25157,original,It was convenient to all the tourist spots and felt very safe.  Would definitely stay there again. Thank you!,,,
25156,original,"Hello,
Our stay was absolutely delightful. The terrace of the house was very practical, and we had a peaceful and enjoyable stay with our large family. The host responded to all our questions promptly. The location of the house is about a 15-20 minute walk to the city center, but if you prefer, you can also take the tram nearby for quicker access. The area where the house is located is quiet and suitable for walking. Everything was spotless and brand new.
Thank you for everything!",,,Thank you for everything!
25155,original,"Perfect spot in an amazing neighborhood. Felt really taken care of by our host, and had everything we needed.
Definitely coming back.",,,Thanks so much for taking such good care of us!
25153,original,"Lovely flat and just what we needed for our short break in Prague. You could walk to a tram stop in 5 minutes, which made getting into the city center very accessible. Highly recommend.",,,"Thank you for letting us stay in your flat, highly recommend !"
25152,translation,"Really great stay in a super location with nice views. Beautiful and clean apartment, perfect communication with the host.",,,"The fridge made strange noises in the apartment at night, for someone who has trouble sleeping this can be disturbing. Otherwise the apartment and your service tip-top. Thank you."
25151,original,Great place,,,
25150,translation,"Very beautiful flat, in a nice point close to the park and greenery and on the other hand with very easy access to the centre of Prague. I recommend !!!",,,
25149,translation,"The AirBnB is really great. Top location, everything within walking distance, super clean, nicely furnished, great view over the city.
We had the feeling that the pots didn't fit the induction hob and therefore cooking took a long time. Otherwise we would have appreciated a kitchen towel and a hand towel.
And the noise from outside is very loud, but the location is great.
The rest was absolutely great. A very clear recommendation :)",,,"Thanks for everything, it was really great.
As I said, a kitchen towel, hand towel and suitable pots would still be recommended.
But the accommodation was really great."
25148,translation,"Flat as expected. However, a few points need to be made (1) The curtains are translucent and the orientation of the flat means that the sun beats down on them in the morning. This means that at summer solstice time (June 2025), the flat is extremely bright in the morning, making it impossible to sleep beyond 7am without a night mask (although a night mask is provided by the host). (2) The glass bins came around 6am on Friday and were very noisy so our 1st night was cut short. (3) The neighbour's dog barked all night Friday and until 5am so our 2nd night was completely ruined. This was not the fault of the host, just an external nuisance. The other 2 nights were fine. We did experience an internet outage but this was promptly resolved. Communication with Prague Days was excellent. No air conditioning, temperature of 27°C at night...",,,Perhaps a second fan would come handy in the second room. It was really hot. Thermostat was showing 27°C. Is it so much of a problem to provide better light insulation ? I think not tbh. Small kids need a lot of sleep and don't sleep with a mask on...
25147,translation,"Everything is great, a dishwasher would make the flat perfect.",,,
25146,original,Nice place,,,
25145,translation,"I stayed here for just under a week and was very happy with my stay:)
We were able to walk to all the main Prague attractions and there was a tram right in front of the house, which was great. The room was very well soundproofed and perfect for a good night's sleep as you can see nature from the bedroom and the city centre from the living room.
Prague Days always answered all my questions quickly and kindly, and shared information about festivals that only Prague locals know about that you can't find on the internet, which made my stay very enjoyable. Thanks to them, we had a great stay!",,,
25144,original,"We had a lovely time as a family during our stay the location was great, the space was clean, and the host was responsive and friendly. However, we were disappointed to find that the listing mentioned two bedrooms, but there was actually only one. This made sleeping arrangements a bit tight for our family. Additionally, the beds were quite uncomfortable, which affected our overall rest during the stay. With a few improvements and clearer listing details, this place could be a much better experience.",,,
25143,translation,"Flat with excellent repair and perfect cleanliness. Vinohrady neighbourhood is wonderful! I liked it even more than the centre. The most delicious and inexpensive cafes in 3 minutes on foot. Near the park and children's playground. To the centre 15-20 minutes by tram or 7 minutes by taxi.
Pros: neighbourhood, cleanliness, beautiful design with good furniture, powder and detergents and everything for life.
Cons: the living room windows face the main street with tram, it is noisy to sleep there. The bedroom is a bit quieter but no black out curtains (hopefully the owners can fix this and hang dark curtains). No freezer.
Big disadvantage - check in at 16:00!!! Check out at 10:00!!! That's very early! And the agency doesn't go out of their way to accommodate you to check out later. If this suits you, then feel free to book.",,,"It would be great to have black out curtains in the bedroom, it was very bright and we had to cover the windows with a duvet."
25142,original,"Very nice apartment, very centrally located, I would definitely come back.",,,
25141,original,"We loved the stay, the location, the place. We experienced a couple of hickups initially, but overall the Prague Days was always trying to be the most helpful and ultimately helped us resolve most of the things. They were proactive also in recommending things to do, so overall we would recommend this place and Prague Days.",,,"Hello, we would like to thank you again for a beautiful stay in your place. We left 4 stars only due to challenges with the beds, kids chair and bed in the beginning and wifi throughout our stay, but we feel like we will use your services in the future again, since overall our experience was great (especially my stay in the place in your place in Mala strana is flawless). Thanks again!"
25140,translation,"The host was responsive and allowed us to stay for a couple of hours because of our difficulties with moving for which we thank him very much ♥️.
In general we left a positive comment from which I am sure the host will draw conclusions and will definitely prepare everything as it should be for the next guests 🙂 🙂",,,"Thanks again for letting us stay for a couple of hours, it was very helpful.
Overall everything is perfect very nice flat, but there are a couple of very important things that should be corrected.
Pay more attention to cleaning, the flat is not shiny, dust on the shelves, in the shower there is no smell that all washed with chlorine.
The curtain in the shower should be changed, it is already darkened from the bottom, it is very unpleasant, it should be changed once a month, very bad smell from the sewer in the shower, maybe more chlorine should be poured into the pipes.
The sofa and the carpet should be replaced, they are like dust collectors in this flat, the sofa is sweating, the carpet cannot be vacuumed properly, there is a lot of dust behind the sofa, I would recommend to replace such a plush sofa with another one that is easier to clean, the same is true for the carpet.
And lastly for some reason it is very hot in the toilets, we understand that it is because of the heating pipes and nothing can be done about it."
25139,translation,"Everything went smoothly. Great communication, quick response to questions. Always happy to return",,,Thank you
25138,original,Great place to stay!,,,
25137,original,While we did enjoy our stay it was a little difficult to get in because there are two different codes given for check-in that got confusing. There was also no seating on the terrace like pictured. Other than that it was very clean and easy once we figured everything out. I reached out to them about water leaking in the bathroom and they sent someone immediately and were very responsive. Great location right next to a tram stop.,,,
25136,original,Great location right around the block from tram stop. Fast communication with host company. A lot of direction on how to park the car and get in the apartment. Strong AC. Nice size balcony but view is not very exciting. Not very  flexible when it comes to early/late check in/out. Check in time is very late and check out time is earlier than comparable Airbnb out there. Other than that no other complaints.,,,
25135,original,"Apartment is perfect, host is amazing. We stayed a week at the apartment, and enjoy the full stay. Thanks for the support and hep 24/7 of the host. Dont be scared of the no-elevator 3-stories: once there, you will not want to leave the apartment!",,,Thanks a lot for your help and support on our stay. Thanks (THANKS) for fixing the TV for our stay. We would love to come back soon!!
25134,original,"We had a wonderful stay at this beautiful house. The host was very thoughtful and provided everything we needed for a comfortable experience, including a fully equipped kitchen and a dishwasher, which made things much easier for us.

We were a group of five, and the house accommodated all of us comfortably. The location is also very convenient—there’s a bus stop right outside, making it easy to get around. For those arriving by car, we parked at P+R Chodov and reached the house in just 15 minutes using the bus and metro.

Although the property had only a few reviews when I booked, I’m glad I went ahead—the hosts are genuine and incredibly welcoming. I can fully recommend this place to others.",,,

The accommodation is modernly furnished, very clean and offers everything you need - from comfortable beds to a fully equipped kitchen. We particularly liked the bright living room with its large dining table and smart TV with Netflix. The location is great - quiet yet central. Check-in was straightforward and well organised.

Would recommend it to everyone.",,,Thank you!
25127,translation,"Outstanding host. She made sure to make our stay filled with additional experiences by keeping us informed of current events during our stay.
The apartment is equipped with everything you need and is suitable for both short and extended stays.
Top location relative to all attractions in Prague. Everything we planned to visit was within walking distance. We did not have to use public transport, although my impression from a previous stay in Prague is that public transport is very well organised. We travelled by car and booked parking in advance. The nearest car park was not suitable for the length of our car. The maximum possible length of the car is indicated on the car park website. We took this into account and booked another one within 15 minutes walking distance of the apartment, but this was not a problem as we did not use the car throughout our stay.

Recommend. Book with no worries.",,,"Hello.
Thank you for your hospitality and care during our stay. Although it was not a serious discomfort, I recommend you take care of the air conditioning of the apartment. A mobile air conditioner is not suitable as the warm air needs to be exhausted outside the room to be effective. I assume that the status of the building does not allow you to install a unit on the facade.
However, I would certainly book this apartment again on my next stay in Prague or with you as host.
Thank you again."
25126,original,"Very clean place, and is even nicer than the pictures! Has a lot of things in the kitchen, loved staying there!",,,
25125,original,"clean nice apartment, good communication, reasonably priced",,,
25124,original,"Another great stay hosted by Prague Days — they are always responsive and reliable.

The apartment is in a lovely neighborhood with a real local feel. It’s modern, with great natural light and convenient touches like a quality hair dryer, iron, and an amazing walk-in closet which helps keep things organized during your stay. The seating options are cozy, and the shower has excellent water pressure.

Like many Airbnbs, there’s some normal wear and tear,  but it was comfortable and well-equipped. There’s no AC, but the fan and cross-breeze from open windows kept things comfortable for me. Do note that there’s some nearby construction at the moment, which adds to the morning noise — light sleepers might need to use earplugs. 

Overall, a great stay — I’d definitely consider coming back!",,,"I had such a great day thanks as always, for being such good hosts…

My only complaints or feedback would be from the perspective of a clean freak ^_^. 

 I noticed some areas in the apartment that are easily skipped during the regular cleaning required to turn the apartment. The silver wall/doors to the second bathroom/washing machine have a ton of fingerprints on them… one of my pet peeves personally - may not bother other others.

It also seemed like the bathroom floor didn’t get cleaned all the way up to that frosted glass wall behind the sink, and the frosted glass wall could use some attention as well on both sides… 

The drawer in the refrigerator has some sort of staining on it that is a little offputting.

Note: The apartment doesn’t feel dirty. These are just little things I noticed, and would attend to if I lived there permanently.

Thank you again for your gracious hosting and I look forward to staying at a Prague days property in the future."
25123,original,"Very nice accommodation. A bit noisy, but otherwise everything was perfect. Highly recommended!",,,"Very nice accommodation. Only two things, there were no trash cans in the bathrooms. Also, there was no toilet paper. But that was it; otherwise, everything was perfect. Thank you very much."

Anyhow, it is a luxury apartment.",,,"All was very interesting and amazing, by adding AC will be the best place to stay in Prague.
Thank you!"
25121,original,Super,,,
25120,original,"I loved my stay here, the apartment was very comfortable: the bed was amazing and everything was really clean, and for me cleanliness is the most important thing. The place is situated in a beautiful building set in an area well connected by tram. I am a woman who was travelling solo for work and always felt safe there. The team of Prague Days assured that everything was going well with the apartment and had great communication.",,,Thank you again
25119,original,Everything was good. Thank you!,,,
25118,translation,"THE FLAT WAS FINE: CLEAN AND WITH EVERYTHING WE NEEDED FOR OUR NEEDS. THE STAIRS TO ACCESS THE APARTMENT CAN BE A PROBLEM FOR PEOPLE WITH MOBILITY PROBLEMS. WHAT WE DIDN'T LIKE WAS THAT AS THERE WAS NO PARKING, IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO PARK THE CAR UNLESS YOU BOOKED A PUBLIC PARKING SPACE ONLINE. FOR US IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DO SO BECAUSE WE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE SYSTEM IN PRAGUE FOR RESERVING A PARKING SPACE ON THE STREET. NEAR THE HOUSE THERE IS A BUS STOP THAT BRINGS YOU TO THE METRO OR TRAM BECAUSE WALKING BOTH MEANS OF TRANSPORT ARE FAR AWAY AND UP AND DOWN THE HILL.",,,I THINK IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT FOR THEM TO PROVIDE ONE OF THE THREE PRIVATE PARKING SPACES IN THE HOUSE TO MAKE IT EASIER TO PARK THE CAR. OR AT LEAST PROVIDE A PUBLIC PARKING SPACE NEXT TO THE HOUSE BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO DO SO AND WE DON'T KNOW IF WE WILL HAVE BEEN SANCTIONED BY THE POLICE.

25114,original,I had a great stay.  The studio was clean and as shown in pictures.  Host was very responsive and friendly.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again next time I'm in Prague.,,,
25113,translation,"The apartment has a nice terrace and the advantage is that it is located right opposite the tram stop - two stops from Anděl, which is practical. Unfortunately, the stay itself was not comfortable for me. The bed was extremely soft, I didn't get enough sleep and left with a blocked neck. The coffee maker didn't work properly - instead of coffee, only water with loger flowed out. There were crumbs in the table, which is not a big deal, but it seemed like the cleaning was not quite finished. Overall rather disappointing. For the price of over 4500 CZK I would have expected a much higher level of service. A detail like disposable slippers would have been useful. I managed the stay, but I would not choose it again.",,,

25099,original,More beautiful in person than the pictures. I stayed here for 20 days and it was great. The host was extremely communicative and prompt when i needed help.

Was super comfortable. Highly recommended,,,
25098,original,Amazing stay and amazing host,,,All was perfect
25097,original,"A wonderful stay in the center of Old Town!  The apartment was spacious, clean, comfortable and perfectly located in the heart of Prague. The host did an amazing job at detailing instructions on how to access/utilize the property.  Thanks!",,,
25096,original,"Apartment was nice enough and location central, but wouldn’t book again with this host or this location. Host is very corporate and they nickel and dime you for everything. We were 4 people plus a baby staying for a week. Asked about a crib which usually comes standard in most airbnbs and they request about $60 claiming was extra and difficult to provide. Can’t claim to be efficient and corporatized company and then be unable to provide basic extra amenities. Same deal when asked for extra set of keys as only one set was provided for FOUR people. That will be an extra $15 on top of the $1800 we already paid for the trouble of “making copies” and bringing them over. Even though they needed to come by anyway to clean the AC air filters which were beyond disgusting.

Last issue which isn’t host’s fault is that there were mounds of trash left in the lobby of the building for nearly the entire time we were there which stunk up entire lobby area. TLDR: find somewhere else to stay.",,,

The place is as advertised and the people who run it are super responsive to any queries we had. Thanks for a lovely time :)",,,"We had a great stay here which is outlined in the review we left. On a side note, which obviously has nothing to do with the flat, the neighbours downstairs had a dog which had a tendency to bark at all sorts of bizarre times and more strangely seemed to have urinated all over the stairwell so it made walking up to the flat not as pleasant as it should have been. Of course this is not a reflection on your work but just something to be mindful of for future guests. On a plus note it was a great flat and we had a fabulous time and for that we are very grateful."

25085,translation,"The location is exceptional. But one step at a time, as this will come in handy for all those who will use this flat.
Very important information: the key box is located in the building opposite the flat. So there is no point in looking around just having to cross the street. And that is the only inconvenience.
The location is fantastic. Everywhere close. And to the shop and to the old town, and to the underground. Simply everywhere.
The flat is clean. It's a beautiful antique interior with an arched ceiling. Atmospheric. Equipped with all necessary appliances. Two bedrooms. One with a window, the other without a window and very low. Two tiny balconies. Despite the fact that the flat is located in the centre it is quiet and peaceful.
I recommend to everyone. Good price for a beautiful place in the centre of Prague. Next time I won't be looking for anything else but here straight away.
Thank you also to the hosts for looking after us :)",,,"Thank you for your stay and the quick resolution of problems.
I have no comments except one regarding the smell in the flat. I feel that the kitchen worktop, which is made of wood, would be worth a decent refresh as it is soaked with old grease.
And also the kettle for heating water I would replace.
Other than that, great.
It's a beautiful place, take care of it :)

Great place for 6 or more guests. 
The location was great, tram right at the entrance, including restaurants and shops.
Very close walking distance to many tourist sites, kids playground about 5 minute walk.

The only minor negatives were:
There was only 1 set of keys, which was challenging for 2 families wanting to explore the city independently, the host provided the second set for 300 CZK.
The shower was OK for me but someone tall might find it very low.
We couldn't find any liners and had to purchase them.

- overall our stay was acceptable but we paid similar to equivalent of two nice hotel rooms so value was questionable.  If you have a larger group of 6-8 and want to stay together then it would make more sense.",,,Thanks for the accommodation and communicating with us during the stay.
25063,original,Place was good and location is nice but wasn’t given any flexibility for check out and asked to pay 150 eur for 1hr late checkout. Not what i would expect for a place this expensive. All good otherwise,,,

25060,original,Genuinely an excellent stay. Accommodation was great and the company were really helpful throughout the stay. Would 100% stay again!,,,Thanks so much for a great stay! Alex 😊
25059,translation,Very tastefully furnished apartment and best location. Very clean and quick communiication. You can reach the centre quickly on foot and the tram stop is just around the corner. Highly recommended!,,,
25058,translation,"We had an excellent time! We appreciated the fully equipped kitchen, dishwasher, washing machine, washing machine, fully equipped bathroom, iron, ironing facilities and the clean, high, elegantly decorated rooms.

What I think could be improved: doors and windows - to change and modernise. Being a two-bedroom accommodation, doors that are much better sound insulating between rooms and close hermetically would be appropriate.

All in all we had a great time and the fact that the location is ultra ultra central is a huge plus.

Thanks for everything!",,,"Hi, Kamila!

Thanks for hosting. We had an excellent time! We appreciated the fully equipped kitchen, dishwasher, washing machine, fully stocked bathroom, iron, ironing facilities and the clean, high, elegantly decorated rooms.

What I think could be much improved: the doors and windows - to be changed and modernised (including the front door). Being a two bedroom accommodation I think doors should be put in that are much better sound insulating between the rooms and close tightly. Also, the door to the glazed bedroom is only downstairs...upstairs being empty space and it is loud when someone else is in the bathroom or kitchen.

Wish we could have found 2-3 pairs of slippers. I would also activate the cable (if it wasn't already activated). I would have liked to watch a few Czech TV channels. :)

Overall we had a great time and the fact that the location is ultra ultra central is a huge plus.

Thanks for everything!"

The landlord was great at communicating and actively helped with the whole accommodation process.
Suitable for both private and business stays - definitely recommend 👍.",,,
25056,translation,"Well located, unfortunately some sockets did not work. Furthermore, the bed was replaced and the mattress was simply placed in the living room and only replaced on request. We were there with 8 people, and the location is very good and with 8 people you can stay there well. However, only 1 key is provided, each additional one costs 10€!!!! This is far too unreasonable, with the number of people you can already assume 2 pairs of keys. Otherwise good, just not really tidy.",,,
25055,translation,"After helpful tips regarding tram connections to our accommodation, we got from the station to the beautiful house and immaculately clean and invitingly designed flat. Really nothing was missing. Quiet, pleasant district, close to the Vltava River on the Lesser Town and a 15-minute walk to the Old Town. Comfortable mattress, very well equipped kitchen and bathroom, view of the countryside, good places for breakfast and restaurants nearby and just a few minutes' walk to the forest on Petrin Hill. Tram to the old town and Hradčany around the corner. We would really recommend accommodation for 2 people.",,,
25054,translation,"On the whole it was good.

About 25min (pleasant) walk from the old town.
Loft bed and sofabed both very comfortable.
Kitchen was immaculate including a fridge and washing machine.

Plenty of hot water, and a good bathroom. 

However the place lacked any character at all, no view nor balcony, nor any feature to make it worth a photo or memorable.  For the price it was a bit meh!",,,"thanks for being so responsive to our request for sheets.

-I wish they had black out curtains(there’s no built in sunshade) difficult to sleep in the morning!",,,The dishwasher was filthy and smelly! We had to buy paper plates and cups.
25036,original,"This apartment looks exactly like the pictures. It is very modern and new and comfortable. The kitchen is well equipped for meal preparation, but this neighborhood has lots of great restaurants to explore, too!

Holešovice is full of great local spots and all of the general amenities you would need including easy access to transportation, close grocery stores, etc. 

The hosts are very responsive They replied back to me very quickly when I had questions and they left a lot of great recommendations in a guide inside the apartment. Wi-Fi is great. I was able to work from there for the week without a hitch. 

Some facts: there is no elevator and the apartment is two floors up from street level worth considering if you have a ton of luggage. 
The apartment has AC so if you prefer the windows closed for more peace & quiet you can stay cool in Summer! 
The plumbing in the building is old and requires some care on the part of the guest.  

I would stay here again - thank you Prague Days!",,,"Hello! I left you some direct feedback about the check-in process in the message part of this app. 

A note about the plumbing--if you refer to the Airbnb review  for the stay right before mine… I experienced a similar thing with the water/toilet situation.  After flushing the toilet, sometimes there would be smells coming from the bathroom sink. 
Also, there would be  gurgling sounds in the kitchen & in the shower after flushing the toilet. 
The sign on the toilet says “don’t put toiletries in the toilet” 
My initial assumption was that it meant feminine products. I didn’t realize it meant toilet paper wouldn’t go down when flushed. A more explicit instruction could be helpful, such as “Do not flush toilet paper, place it in the waste bin.” 

I assume this is all related to the age of the building/plumbing . But thought it was worth mentioning since the other person did say something in their review.  
Thanks again for being great hosts! I really enjoyed my stay."
25035,translation,"I had a lovely experience with this host. The location is excellent. The studio looks exactly as in the photos and access was easy. Thank you, host and Prague Days.",,,"Personally, I could only use the TV on YouTube... maybe there should be user instructions in English. Otherwise, I was very satisfied."
25034,original,"Staying with Prague Days was a pleasure. The location was perfect, it’s just outside the main area so extremely quiet with a tram just around the corner that gets you into the main area in 10 minutes. The apartment was cozy and clean with amazing views from the roof terrace. There was someone always available to reply to any messages and all of the information/instructions we were sent were very helpful and accurate. We also tried out a few of the restaurant recommendations from Prague days with Waf-Waf (5-10 minute walk) being an incredible highlight. We would gladly stay here again and would highly recommend it to anyone who’s looking for a base to explore Prague.",,,"Your place was perfect, thank you so much for hosting us. Our only issue was the bed pillows which were a bit flat for us but we know that pillows are a personal preference and not everyone will like every pillow. Thank you again 😊"

25030,original,"The place is good, all the reviews stating the walkability and describing amenities are correct. 
There were several issues though:
- we said we’d check in at 8pm, but we actually came to town at around 5. They let us leave the bags but the apartment was not cleaned and we were informed about it. If you ask me - if the check in is at 3pm, the apartment should be ready regardless of the guests coming later;
- there’s only one set of keys for an apartment for 4+ people, this was extremely inconvenient. When I asked for another set I was offered to pay for it. This is weird, a deposit I would understand but why would I pay for the keys that I leave behind in 4 days. Please consider offering 2 sets of keys to the guests who come in companies;
- the ventilation didn’t switch off at all and we were told a specialist would come and check it - no one came; it was noisy 24/7
Overall the apartment is good, communication is decent but the issues were not solved",,,

25027,original,Nice location and had all the listed amenities.,,,We were asked if we would be available to let someone in the property to repair the router. They never turned up - it wasn't a major issue but we did delay going out because of this. Something to consider in the future.

It contained everything you need to live, even a washing machine and tumble dryer were available. The kitchen was fully equipped with all the usual electrical appliances. Fast Internet and WLAN were also available and easy to set up. The underground car park was also spotlessly clean. The connection to public transport was perfect, 50 metres to the tram and 100 metres to the metro station and you were in the centre and Prague's old town in just a few stops. In short, it was the perfect stay and starting point for us to explore the city. If I come to Prague again, I really want to stay in exactly this flat again 😀",,,"Everything was actually perfect for our stay, we really enjoyed the accommodation and the location.
Only the cleaning staff still have a little room for improvement.
Not that it seemed unclean, no, but the cooker, microwave and the mirror in the bathroom still had streaks of dirt.
And this is of course complaining on a very high level and please don't criticise the cleaning staff for that. I think it was because we arrived as planned and on time for check-in, but the cleaning staff were still not ready and seemed visibly irritated when we suddenly stood in front of the door.
And as I said, we would want to check into this exact flat again on our next stay in Prague.
Best regards

25017,original,Very good service!,,,
25016,translation,Very nicely furnished and clean flat. The crockery was a bit dirty from the previous owner (no dishwasher available). Close to the centre but still quiet. Nice garden with terrace to sit out.,,,
25015,original,"The good: Location was good, about a 20min walk to the astronomical clock. Washer and dryer were nice to have, though the dryer is finicky.  Prague Days had good email updates of things going on in the city. The bad: This place was so dirty. There were black specks/fluffies on the beds and floor. My 2 yr old walked through the curtain to be silly. We stopped him and took the curtain off, he had black stuff on his face.  It has a very small kitchen/ dining/living room area. The kitchen knives are very dull. Curtains let a lot of light in, even at night, they need to be deep cleaned and fixed. Friday and Saturday nights were noisy. They provided ear plugs and eye masks. My child’s and my allergies started acting up so much. We left the place cleaner than we found it. We should have left upon arrival, but the thought of relocating 7ppls things and finding a new place for 7 was daunting. We should have anyway. We would have left early if friends hadn’t been staying near us.",,,"Deep clean everything, especially the curtains. Finish tiling the bathroom. Grout the tile in the shower."
25014,translation,"Due to the now high hotel prices, we booked a holiday flat on Airbnb for the first time. Our focus is always on a cheap parking space for the car and secure storage for the bikes. But of course the feel-good factor is also important. After intensive research into the price, location and description of the accommodation, we came across this great flat.
The flat on offer looks exactly like the photos. There is nothing ""fake"". The description and details of the flat are also correct. The two of us stayed in the flat for just under two weeks and only spent the night and had breakfast there, as we were out and about every day until the evening.
The very short distances to the apartment/garage/bicycle room/trash are absolutely perfect. Everything right by the lift. Absolutely great!
Small drawback: There is no satellite TV. Only Czech TV. But we were able to stream on the TV with various providers. A TV in the bedroom would be desirable.",,,"The description of the flat clearly states that there is no satellite TV and that it can only be streamed (hope I haven't overlooked this). A TV in the bedroom would be great (aerial socket is available). I'm not sure, but I don't think I've read anything about where to put the household rubbish. I found it instinctively :)
Otherwise everything is perfect.

We felt very comfortable and would come back at any time. It was wonderful. Many thanks for the great support and the time in Prague."
25013,original,"Great location in the old town and the street is fairly quiet.  Two really good sized bedrooms, large separate lounge and well equipped kitchen/dining with a small balcony.  Bathroom good with shower/bath and very useful to have another toilet separate.  

The location is perfect for walking to most of the sights and there are many good restaurants, cafes, bars nearby.

Only one set of keys is provided which can be a bit limiting if there are four people staying.  It took a little while to get a second set for which we paid a small additional amount.  Suggest you ask in advance if you want extra keys.

Wonderful stay here, thoroughly recommend.",,,"Don’t think that the dishwasher is working very well, might be worth checking.  Not a complaint, just an observation!"
25012,original,"Our stay was amazing. After my previous host just cancelled my reservation a week before my trip, I found Prague Days. The apartment was spacious, clean, and everything was provided as in the offer. The A/C was a nice addition during hotter days. The area around is calm and beautiful, with a tram stop just 2 steps from the front door. The terrace view is just beautiful. I always had a quick support if needed. I can only recommend this apartment and I will definitely go back there in the future :)",,,

25008,original,"The flat is in a very good location, accessible to many shops, cafes and restaurants. Located near the old town and the main train station, everywhere is walkable. The flat was spacious, had a well stocked kitchen and basic amenities. However, we personally felt that there wasn't enough privacy considering the lack of curtains. There were see-through curtains in the bedroom, but none in the living space. We also had a minor problem with check-out, as the host promised us late check-out at 6pm the night before but then changed their plans at 10pm when we were already asleep, leading to a very rushed morning for us. They were however understanding we might not be able to make it out on time, we had an overall great experience with Prague Days. Check in was smooth and pleasant. Prague Days were also very responsive and helpful regarding recommendations. They helped us settle into prague with a 2h earlier check in, which we really appreciate!",,,

1.	Fast and polite replies
2.	Easy check-in and check-out
3.	Netflix available on the TV
4.	Great location for transport and food
5.	Washing and ironing tools provided

Unfortunately, some issues negatively impacted our stay, which we also reported:
1.	Dirty, stained bowls upon arrival
2.	Constant noise from construction (upstairs neighbour as early as 8 am) and thin walls (noise at night) 
3.	Extremely limited and awkwardly placed storage (one small wardrobe about 40cm wide with one shelf + hanging space, barely enough for one person, in the corner stuck between the bed, the wall, and a stool) 
4.	Bugs in the bathroom!
5.	Freezer not cold enough, the size of a matchbox, that makes a lot of noise though in the night

We appreciate the efforts but we hope future stays will benefit from a few improvements! Thank you for your hospitality.",,,
25006,original,"The apartments were cozy and warm. Air conditioning was also available. A big plus is that there is an elevator in the building.

Otherwise everything went smooth.",,,
25002,translation,"1-When going up to the apartment, the iron railing of the staircase was probably broken and dismantled and was not in place, which is a very, very dangerous thing for the child!

2-The battery of the door lock of the apartment is dead and we could have stayed outside if we did not check it, how can they rent the apartment without checking the battery? This is a major oversight! Also, the lock combination for the outer door and the apartment door did not seem very secure.

3-The seats and carpets in front of the exit door were black and incredibly dirty!!!

4-One chair and the dining table were shaking, you can fall at any time if you sit on that chair

5-Hand soap and detergent mixed with water of poor quality

6-They made a plasterboard wall in front of the double bed, a huge frame on the wall fell while the child was playing on the bed

7-There is no cabin for shower, so water goes everywhere

8-Since there is only a glass door separating the shower and toilet from the room, when you take a shower, the humidity enters the whole room and the room was extremely stuffy, we had to open the window constantly!",,,

A very responsive host:-
They were super-quick to deal with an Internet provider outage, sending a colleague out with a portable hotspot within 30mins even though it was 9.30pm on a Saturday night.

The only slight annoyance for us was that one of the bed bases was (kind of) broken - the slats kept falling down which made the mattress sag down - and although this was acknowledged by the host, we were not offered the option to have it fixed during our stay. With hindsight maybe we should have made more of a fuss about this, but we were very busy as we were visiting Prague for an event so it wasn't top of our ""to do"" list.  Based on the rest of our very positive stay, I imagine Prague Days will have already  sorted it out.",,,"Give instructions as to how to make the door entry system work from within the apartment - we had to walk all the way down to the main door to let our daughter in.

Get coffee pods that are properly compatible with the machine - the tops of the ones you provided do not pierce properly so the coffee only comes out in a dribble.

Thanks"

Despite that, everything else was so great that I didn’t feel like anything was missing.

In general the apartment is super, but you should look into some smaller repairs like the door to the downstairs bathroom that is loose, the curtain in the downstairs bedroom, detached in one side and the shower head-holder upstairs that is loose and therefore does not function properly. Also the coffee machine makes very small cups of coffee, even for an espresso. 

But in general a very nice place, I would definitely return another time.

24975,original,"We enjoyed our stay at this apartment. The location was excellent, very easy to get to all the main tourist sights on foot. The apartment was furnished nicely, and very spacious. Just be careful outside one of the bedrooms is a step down, its quite easy to miss and then fall. The kitchen doesn't have a microwave, which would have been really useful. 

We had a little difficulty reaching the key safe when we were checking in, it was quite high up. We asked for some help inputting the code to the key safe, and Prague Days were very responsive and helpful over the phone, even at 10pm when we arrived. We contacted them for help on ""unlocking"" the stove top, again they were very helpful and easy to get hold of. 

I would suggest using the Uber Aiport service for transfers to and from the airport. Very efficient and professional, and a very good rate. 

Overall, we really enjoyed our stay, and would definitely book this apartment again if staying in Prague.",,,Thanks for a great stay!

24969,original,Good experience,,,
24968,original,"A very nice apartment – clean, cozy, and exactly as shown in the photos. It’s well-equipped, and I especially appreciated the TV with Netflix. The blackout curtains were a great touch for better sleep. The only minor issue is that there’s no dedicated parking, but this was clearly stated in advance, so it wasn’t a problem. We were able to stop briefly in front of the building to unload our things.",,,
24967,original,"I spent a week in this lovely apartment. It feels very modern and comfortable, with a great accessibility to the city center. Area is calm at night, yet there is a lot of nearby restaurants, bars and cafes, as well as metro station. It’s a perfect blend of calm area and a city life. Host was always helpful and responsive.",,,
24966,original,Excellent,,,
24965,original,"Exactly as it says on the tin. Close to town and trams. Restaurants nearby, shopping centers.",,,
24964,translation,Beautiful accommodation. Quiet neighbourhood. Public transport within walking distance.,,,"Unfortunately no towel rail. And too few towels. The argument with the washing machine doesn't work - after all, you don't go into the cellar to wash and dry 1 towel."
24963,translation,"All in all, the accommodation was good.
I would like to emphasise the cleanliness and the good communication between us and the provider.
Unfortunately, there are also a few weaknesses that need to be mentioned.
The provider shows a garage parking space in his photos, even though this is not stated in the description.
There is also a review from a visitor about this car park. We were told that the garage car park no longer exists. This means that a garage parking space is advertised here that is no longer available. So please inform yourself in advance.
The location of the accommodation is central but the area is anything but idyllic. There are many drug addicts and homeless people in the neighbourhood. So take care in the evening.
The noise level is immense because, as described in the advert, there is a tram station right outside the door. This was known to us and therefore fine.",,,
24962,original,"Prague Days management company was amazing- great communication, very responsive, friendly, and helpful throughout our stay. The apartment itself was nice and had all the necessary amenities.

The stay was enjoyable overall, though we did have some issues with a strange neighbor across the hall who knocked on our door multiple times, including once in the middle of the night, with vague complaints. There was also a dog in a neighboring unit that barked for extended periods, sometimes up to an hour.

While we would definitely book with Prague Days again due to their excellent service, we would not choose to stay in this particular apartment again.",,,Prague days did a wonderful job thank you!   Our biggest concern beyond the AC drip which you quickly tried to respond to was the very weird neighbor across the hall that made the stay uncomfortable.
24961,original,"Great location.  Comfortable place.  Prague Days, the management company communicated quickly when needed which is appreciated.  Would use it again.",,,"Coffee maker needs to be replaced.  Hardly works and makes tiny cups of coffee that aren't hot.  Should also provide more bath towels for  a 5 night stay.  One bath towel per person for that lengthy of a stay isn't enough.  Overall, we enjoyed the stay.  Thank you."

24959,original,"The place is in a good neighborhood and has nice light and amenities were good. The mattress is not comfortable, you can tell that it’s very cheap and doesn’t conform to your body at all. There were 3 of us and one person on the fold out couch which is also very cheap and not comfortable at all. They did have the couch bed made up for us when we arrived but the way only had 2 real pillows in the whole place, the fold out couch had 2 couch throw pillows put into a pillowcase. We used the laundry which was across the hall and convenient. There is a smell in the pipes in the bathroom that wasn’t super pleasant but they did provide matches and as long as you keep the door shut it’s okay. Good value but could have been more comfortable. Definitely not great for 3 people.",,,"Thank you for hosting us! The location is great and the place feels welcoming and is well decorated. A few things we thought might improve the place would be a more comfortable mattress, one us actually threw their back out partially from the uncomfortable bed. At least a foam mattress topper would be helpful. The pull out couch is also super uncomfortable almost to the point of it being a useless sleeping place. I wouldn’t advise anyone to sleep on it so I would either exchange the couch for a more comfortable pull out or only advertise the apartment for 2 people. 
And on that, we noticed there were only 2 real sleeping pillows, the 3rd being 2 couch throw pillows stuffed into a pillowcase. 
The amount of keys needed to get into the apartment is a lot, which I’m sure is something you cannot control, but I might suggest adding color tops to them or something to help differentiate them. We did try to clean up after ourselves and the vacuum cleaner filter was super clogged!"

We accidentally forgot a set of keys in the inside lock, he took care of everything and sent for the locksmith, the service was excellent. The mattress is very soft. A lovely place.",,,
24954,original,"Wonderful place, artistically and creatively furnished/decorated. Superclean, super responsive hosts. The only downside is that the apartment fronts onto a noisy road with a noisy tram (during nights/early morning), so many of you will need to close the windows to sleep and possibly use ear plugs.

24952,original,"One of the best places I've stayed in Czechia - excellent clean apartment in a very good location. 
The check in was a bit strange, we had to find a lock box on a street in the middle of the night as the flight got delayed, but we passed the quest everything from there was fine :D
The apartment is great, very comfortable, good bed, sockets near the bed to charge phones, a little balcony was very cozy. 
The kitchen is equipped with fridge, freezer, which were very useful. It also had a cooker and dishwasher which we didn't use. 
The bathroom had an excellent shower, and also washing mashine which we didn't use but it's good to have it there. 
There was some minor wear and tear in the flat, the shower door is too short and the water kept splashing into the bathroom, but it wasn't too bad, they had a squeegee so I used that to clean it. 
The block of flats has a lift. 
The Prague Days were very responsive, even in late hours, so we had a great stay overall and I can recommend this flat.",,,

Great communication with very clear instruction.

Very clean, comfortable and quiet apartment, a really good base.  It is a little walk to the town centre but only 10/15 min - we knew that when booking and was fine. But that little distance helps keep the area quiet.

Would definitely recommend and happy to return",,,"Thank you for everything....

The messages and follow-up were very professional.",,,"Improvement points:

1.  Bathrooms have sewer smell, need to improve.

The photos correspond 100% to the impression when you are there. Communication with the host was excellent. They were always available and always interested in our well-being. Check in check out was absolutely smooth. The transport links are also excellent. It's just a little noisy outside if you have the window open, but you're in the centre. You also have a fully air-conditioned flat, so you can leave the window closed.

All in all, an absolute recommendation. We would come back at any time. Many thanks to the team.

Greetings Konrad",,,Everything was tip-top.
24924,original,I recommend this apartment.,,,All good.
24923,original,Stayed at this Airbnb for work. It was very close to the Microsoft building (just a 5 min walk). There were plenty of coffee shops and restaurants within walking distance and taking an Uber to the city center only took about 15 min. The apartment was stylish and minimalist. The bed was comfortable and the Internet was fast. I didn't see an AC so keep that in mind if visiting during the summer. Overall a wonderful experience. Would definitely stay here again.,,,
24922,original,Really enjoyed our stay here while visiting Prague for a city break with friends. The flat was well located in a peaceful area that was a nice 15-20 minute walk to the centre.

Would definitely recommend staying here.,,,Thanks for everything! Really enjoyed the stay.
24921,original,"About house everything is good. But you can’t smoke on the terrace and you need go downstairs for smoke. It’s not a big problem but when it’s rain … And small problem with parking place,they have a sloped garage and if you have a low car you can’t park your car. 
p.s Everything else was great - the house was clean,the host responded promptly,and it was just a 5 minute metro ride to the city center. So I can confidently give the house a 4 out of 5.",,,

Close to everything a tourist can dream of In Prague. I was surprized by quantity of kitchens utensils esp different size pots and pans one could hardly use i a small studio size kitchenette with a basic 2x stove. There are some faults in layout of interior design e. G bed lamps are situated to low for reading, not enough clothes/towel books in the bathroom...

I freaked out when I saw that I had to climb up 3 set of stairs with my bags when I needed to check out because I have a back problem, but eventually I got someone to help me. When I checked with the host, I was encouraged in a friendly way “You got this!! And it’s worth it!!”  And they were right ❤️",,,"Oh so we can send something to you in private🎉🎉 so first thank you again for making it a very comfortable stay. Here are some few remarks to improve 💕
1. Please make sure the cover for the double bed fits a double bed. It was very weird to see only half of the bed covered (annoying for the eye🥲
2. No harm in putting extra pillows. 
3. I’m not sure if anything g can be done about the garbage being placed at the building entrance. Is this the way in buildings in Prague? The smell was suffocating each time we got in 🤪
4. Check in and check out times are incredibly inconvenient as always in Airbnb. Thanks for stretching check out till 12. 
5. The bathroom curtain is placed further away from where one is supposed to stand. It kept sticking on me as I took my shower 😂😂😂

Other than that everything was great 👍 thank you so much 💖💖"

I was personally satisfied, although my partner was less so. I left a positive review on AirBnB. However, I have to make these observations:
- there was dust under the beds and some dirt in the nooks and crannies.
- the washbasin was blocked and the tap ran water very slowly.
- regarding the bedding, it wasn't really comfortable. it was acceptable but not comfortable.
- put detailed instructions on how to use the heating/air conditioning."

The apartment matched our expectations but there was a bit of dirty kitchen utensils but we dished them ourselves nothing to big of a deal. Upon arrival we had to wait a bit, we were told we could check in at 16 and we did so that was not the problem. The problem was that we asked to be let in earlier if possible but they said that they were still cleaning the apartment, so when we arrived at 14:30 we waited in the hallway until 16 and no cleaners ever came  out which was quite disappointing because that ment we could have gone in at 14:30 when we arrived.

By public transport you can reach the centre in 20 minutes. 

The bedrooms are spacious and very comfortable. The apartment is located on a busy street, which has both pros and cons: while it is quiet at night, traffic starts around 5:30 a.m., so light sleepers may want to bring earplugs.

The only major downside is the parking situation: There are private parking spaces in front of the building, but as stated in the description, they are not available for guests. Public parking nearby costs around 25 euros per day, which can significantly increase the cost for those arriving by car. The parking garages are further away.

Other than that, the stay was very pleasant and we felt comfortable in the apartment.",,,Thank you

Thank you for giving us such a clean place to stay with comfortable beds. The view was absolutely gorgeous.

The only thing missing were washcloths for the bathroom (this might be an American thing?) and maybe a pair of scissors in the kitchen. Otherwise, I felt like I was staying at home. 🩷

The apartment was well stocked with paper towel, toilet paper, and the necessities. 

I think that the only other helpful information would be instructions for how to use the dishwasher, washer, and dryer. These are entirely different from models that we use in the USA and we didn’t really know how to use them. 

Thank you again for everything! We enjoyed our stay so much! We plan to rebook with you when we return to Prague!

Suggestion : m

1. the bedroom blind can’t block all the sunshine, because sun raise around 4:xx am.

 2. If the house has the instruction for rubbish handling, I think it is quite easy for me to handle."

24857,original,"Fantastic stay, especially the location and free coffee! Thank you for a wonderful stay.",,,
24856,translation,"We arrived on a midweek day, it had rained just before and there weren't many people on the streets. It was my first use of Airbnb and I was afraid I had chosen a bad area: not so! The area is quiet and there is a cocktail bar very close by (as well as tram stops to go to the centre), so in the evening (between 11pm and 1.30am) I was never afraid, because there were always a few people around and on the vehicles. When we came back very late, however, we opted for a Bolt.
The flat is very nice, you can see that it was recently renovated. Small and cosy, perfect for two people. The terrace is very large and there was even coffee! (It's not easy to find decent coffee in Prague and especially not easy to find cheap coffee, so we were very happy with the machine!).
Only caveat: to open the door you have to pull it while turning the key or it won't open.
Highly recommended flat!",,,
24855,translation,"I was happy with my children in this apartment. There are basic utensils, a fridge, stove, kettle and a top opening washing machine.

If it is available, we will book it again next time. Thank you 🤗💐",,,"I still want to tell you privately that on the 1st day of arrival I found drugs - a packet of Marijuana on top of the fridge.

24851,original,"The apartment is perfect for two, located great, just a few minutes walking distance from the National Theater. The building itself was quiet with very beautiful hall, however the street could be a bit noisy. But since you're in the center of a big city, I assume that should be normal.
The apartment was generally clean, but not shiny. One could see some left small stains in the kitchen plot and some dust, which wasn't a big deal since the sheets and towels were perfectly clean and we didn't spent much time at the apartment cooking or similar.
Luckily there were free coffee tabs at the premises, cause we brought the wrong type. Please note that the coffee machine is Nespresso and NOT Dolce Gusto as in the description.
The bathroom floor has heating, which I absolutely love and there's free shampoo and shower gel.
Overall we had a very good stay at this place, and there is nothing really to complain about. We enjoyed our stay there.",,,"Hi, thanks for hosting us.
Overall we enjoyed the apartment, but there are things you could fix to make the guests' stay even better.
I would suggest a bit more detailed cleaning of the apartment. One of the chairs has loosen legs, may be tighten the screws.
We couldn't start the oven, I am not sure if it was us, or it's not working. 
The hairdryer doesn't heat at all, it just blows cold air.
The description of the coffee machine is wrong - it says it's Dolce Gusto, but it's Nespresso, so we bought the wrong tabs.
But thanks for the complimentary tabs at the premises.
Wish you all the best and hope this review will help.
Best regards,

- slightly later check out time like 12 would be more in line with many other Airbnb 
- one kitchen cabinet smelled bad when first open.. otherwise all very clean
- shower cabinet doesn’t close well

- hanger in one of the master bedroom cupboards didn’t light
- some motion sensors were on while we were living there.. uncomfortable for tenants"

24844,translation,The flat was exactly as described and very nice. Practical with garage directly in the house and only about 10-15 min. from the shopping centre and the old town west of the Vltava. Nice quiet location and very quick response from Prague Days to questions etc. Can recommend the flat to anyone travelling by car and wanting to have a great time in Prague.,,,"I have only positive things to say about the quick responses and I was very happy with the flat. If I am in Prague again I would not hesitate to book the flat again and have a great time there. The only tip on my part, write a little note in the instructions for entering the building that you have to hold the chip for opening the doors outside in front of the intercom (or whatever you call it...) to open the front door. The mechanism is quite inconspicuous (only outside the house, to be clear) and we had to look around a bit / try it out until the door opened ;). Otherwise, as I said, everything was great and we'd be happy to stay again."

24840,original,"We had such a lovely stay at this apartment in Prague! It looks exactly like the pictures: clean, tidy, and very comfortable. The bed was also really comfortable, and having a coffee machine in the apartment was a nice and helpful touch to start the day.

If you enjoy walking, you can absolutely reach the city center on foot, but there's also a tram stop just outside the building, which is super convenient.

Check-in and check-out were smooth and easy. We even arrived an hour early and were able to check in without any issue, which was a great bonus.

The only small thing to note is that there were a few different keys, and it wasn’t immediately clear which key was for which door. Also, you need a key to open the door on the ground floor (just after the elevator) if it’s closed, which might be a bit tricky during check-out. Not a big deal at all, but a little clarification would make it even easier.

Overall, a great experience, highly recommended!",,,

I enjoyed my stay at your apartment!

some food for thought though: I would prefer that you asked what information I needed instead of sending it all at once, this made the check in a bit complicated with sorting it out. 
I also recommend that you invest in an aircondition, if this was summertime it would be impossible for me. which would be a shame as the apartment is great!

24755,original,An excellent place to stay. The apartment has everything you need.  Near all attractions. I will stay again.  Thank you,,,Good job.

Everything is great, the car park is in a garage and everything is beautiful in the residence.",,,
24752,original,"My best recommendations, location was great, a lot of restaurants and train station nearby if you ever need it. The apartment is clean, beautiful and the host was very kind! 10/10",,,
24751,translation,"Our stay in the flat was excellent. Tastefully designed, exact to the pictures, in a very good and extremely quiet area, next to the Vltava River and 20 minutes walk from the Old Town. Very comfortable, felt like coming back to rest, the bed was huge and very comfortable and the sofa was great to enjoy Netflix at the end of an intense day in Prague.  The kitchen has all the necessary equipment for cooking. They also have the detail of offering amenities (gel, shampoo, conditioner, moisturizer and even earplugs and sleep mask, very useful considering that it is almost 5 am! We would also like to emphasize the quick attention of the management team. always attentive to messages. you feel accompanied during the whole stay. and Prague, a dream destination. everything perfect. Thank you!",,,thank you for your attention during these days! we have enjoyed the city and the flat very much.
24750,translation,Very nice apartment that had everything we needed. Good location both with local transport or a slightly longer walk to discover the city.,,,Great apartment and nothing to complain about except that some knives in the kitchen were not washed at all. Thanks for a nice stay!
24749,translation,"Accommodation was very central, public transport nearby. Unfortunately there was a building site opposite the flat so it was very noisy early in the morning. Flat had everything we needed and was well laid out. Unfortunately, the bed was not very comfortable and made noise every time we turned over.",,,

Tow",,,Great apartment.
24747,original,Great location and the apartment itself. Would recommend!,,,
24746,original,"My wife and I loved staying in this penthouse apartment in Prague 2! It was a perfect smartly designed retreat for my wife to rest and relax while I attended some classes during the day nearby. The quiet street is a lovely place for anyone to call home during their stay, especially since it is only a few blocks away from convenient trams or subway rides directly to the Old Town. The bathroom is large, and we were very happy to take advantage of the washer/dryer to clean some laundry since we had been traveling already for a few weeks through other parts of Europe. Not too hard to figure out how to use the washer/dryer after a bit of online research. We made a few home cooked meals here and it was a delight to enjoy this kitchen. Also, only one day was warm enough for us to use the AC, but we were super glad it was a feature of this apartment!. The elevators always worked perfectly so we didn’t have to worry about walking up so many flights of stairs. All in all A+++!!!",,,"Thanks so much for the great attention and the lovely stay!!! 

A few notes for your housekeeping / maintenance crew, not as criticisms, but only because I am also in the property management business:
 
1) the shower drains slowly

2) After the tech came and shut off the breaker to the motion activated light switch in the closet, we realized that same circuit must have also shut off the plug outlets we were using by the bed stopped working. You might need an electrician to replace the motion activated switch.

3) We couldn’t figure out how to turn on the large lamp or the ceiling bulb in the living room area.

4) The throw blanket in the living room was dirty.

Again, none of these issues diminished our enjoyment of our stay, and we greatly appreciate the terrific communication and the responsiveness getting us the extra towel and extra key (which we left by the door with the original key). We hope we can stay in one of your lovely homes again next time we visit your beautiful City!"
24745,translation,Everything went without a hitch.,,,"Hey:) Actually everything was great with the flat! We only noticed two small things.

1) the floor was a bit dirty in some areas. But also not bad.
2) The capsules for the coffee machine didn't fit. It was a Nespresso Verturo machine but normal Nespresso capsules. That was a bit of a shame.

But otherwise great :) Thank you for letting us be there!
Best regards!"
24744,original,Apartment was well located in a very walkable area.  Very bright and open during the day.,,,
24743,original,"I really enjoyed my 2-week stay at this lovely apartment! The location was great being in walking distance to the old town and center, and to many restaurants and stores. It was also really nice being so close to Vitkov with its gorgeous views of Prague!  It was really quiet, I didn't hear any street noise at all. That said, the front door didn’t seem to block any sound from the inner court yard, so the sound of the neighbor closing their door would wake me - but, the hosts were proactive and provided earplugs! The apartment was comfortable and had everything I needed for a pleasant stay, though a few more kitchen items, like a dish towel and a non-metal spatula, would have been useful. I also would have appreciated a bathroom blind with a bit more privacy. The hosts were always responsive during working hours and always helpful, offering great tips about local events and holidays. The internet and table provided a nice environment for ""home office"" as well! I'd definitely recommend!",,,
24742,translation,"We had to switch to this accommodation at the very last minute because AirBnB had cancelled our first choice (booked 8 months in advance!).
Upon enquiry, it turned out, that there had been a fire in the building of the first accommodation (learned from the owner).
The new accommodation is good in terms of location, but as there were 7 of us, it was cramped. It was just manageable.
Minus point were the mattresses. Almost everyone complained about this.
Tram and supermarket literally next to and opposite the accommodation.",,,Ensuring better mattresses!

24738,translation,"The apartment is spacious, nice and clean. Large hallway, cleverly built-in wardrobes. The bedroom is cozy. It is certainly worth mentioning the large balcony furnished (sofas, table) for a pleasant sitting. The apartment is located in a quiet and peaceful location. There are quite a few grocery stores nearby, e.g. Tesco and also a very good restaurant U Džbánu with seating outside as well. The entrance to the apartment is wheelchair accessible. I was very satisfied with the accommodation and will definitely come back here the next time I visit Prague.",,,"I was very satisfied with the accommodation. However, I would have a few comments for improvement.
- The shower was running in the bathroom,
- if a guest wants to watch TV, they have to pay for a streaming service,
- I would have liked to see the light bulbs wattage increase.
Regards
Martin"
24737,translation,"Everything was fine, the environment was clean and beautiful. I didn't even want to leave, very nice place to live.",,,
24736,translation,"We lived in the apartment together. When I asked for another set of keys, I was told that this was only possible for an additional fee. Also, as we had been in the apartment for more than 21 days, I asked for an extra towel - it is not normal to use one for such a long time - but this was also refused.

I asked for an extra sheet so that my colleague and I could sleep separately, but again I was told that this was only available at an extra cost and that I should have been informed in advance.

There is no lift in the building. The front door has a gap through which it blows and also squeaks a lot. There is an unpleasant smell coming from the washing machine. The dishes were very dirty - all the glasses had stains on them, and even the dishes that were considered ""clean"" had to be washed before cooking.",,,
24735,translation,"One of the best deals we found on AirBnb. Cosy flats, ideal for a couple with a young child, but good enough for a crew of friends too. Check-in instructions the best I've seen. It is worth adding that it is a new block of flats on a newly built estate, so occasionally a little someone will poke a hole from the neighbours. However, this is not a nuisance.",,,
24734,original,Great overall stay. Clean and comfortable apartment with parking. These are the new apartments being built in Smichov. Nearby construction did get a bit noisy on 1 day (7 day stay) and was a bit hot in May 2025 but cooled off at night.,,,Thanks
24733,translation,"The owner was awake and quick to reply to my contact, and above all, the location of the hostel was great, close to the tram station. I recommend it!",,,

24730,translation,Nice flat with good amenities for a short city break in Prague. Shopping centre within walking distance and the tram stop in front of the door. Also a big plus for us was the underground parking for our car!,,,
24729,translation,Nice and spacious accommodation in the centre of town for a good price. Check in was efficient with clear instructions.,,,
24728,translation,"Great accommodation! With a convenient location. Near a shopping centre, bus stops, metro, shops. Close to the city centre and attractions.
Attentive and helpful owner! Thank you very much for the cosy atmosphere of the apartment! We felt right at home.
We will definitely come back to incredible Prague and stay with you!",,,
24727,translation,The biggest plus is that the location is within walking distance to the touristic areas. The house was clean and useful.,,,The lack of a washing machine at home is a drawback for long-term travellers.
24726,translation,"The small flat is totally cute, is very well equipped and has a great roof terrace with views in two directions over Prague - you can see the rooftops lit up by the sunset from your bed! And in the morning the sun shines in again from the other side. The location is great, quiet and yet in the centre of young and modern Letna, there are great cafés, the National Gallery (great breakfast!) and you can get everywhere quickly by tram and metro.  The communication was also fast and very nice. We will definitely be back.",,,"Dear Prague Days, it was all very good, the only annoying thing is the odour that sometimes comes out of the pipes on the terrace. I had already written about this, maybe you can hang something in there or there are other solutions? Otherwise we felt very comfortable. Thank you for everything!"
24725,translation,A beautiful apartment with all the amenities. We really enjoyed it!,,,
24724,original,"I had a great stay at this apartment! The location is absolutely perfect – just a 3-minute walk to the Old Town and right next to the tram stop, which made getting around super easy. The apartment is spacious and comfortable, with everything you need for a short or long stay. The only thing I would mention is that it could really use air conditioning, especially during the summer months. Other than that, everything was great – would definitely recommend!",,,
24723,translation,"The accommodation was everything we expected and more, the place was spotless, clean, comfortable and nice. Very easy to get to the centre, use transport and get around the city.

I would visit the accommodation again.",,,
24721,translation,Ideal base for exploring Prague! Great location and the flat itself very stylish and atmospheric. We will come back for sure!,,,
24720,original,"It was a really nice place to stay but I felt like it was a lot more than others. I chose this as it had air conditioning and a terrace. When arriving the bed down stairs was made not upstairs where the air conditioning is. I messaged them to find out they wanted me to pay a service charge for bringing more bedding. Then changed their minds on the fee as the place had not been fully stocked with cleaning supplies(as they allowed me early check in).

I found the mattress to be stained but the bedding was clean. The fridge was small but adequate as it was only myself staying.",,,Thanks!
24719,original,"We had a wonderful stay at this beautiful and spotless apartment in Prague. The place is exactly as described — clean, modern, and very comfortable. One of the highlights was the private garden, which was quiet, green, and perfect for relaxing after a day of sightseeing.

The location is absolutely ideal — close to all major attractions, great restaurants, and public transport. Everything you need is just a short walk away. The surrounding area is safe and lively, yet the apartment itself is peaceful and quiet.

The infrastructure is excellent: fast Wi-Fi, fully equipped kitchen, and all amenities you might need. I highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Prague. Would definitely stay here again!",,,
24718,original,"Apartment looked like in the photos. It was quite moist inside and hot. Travelling in the summer might be complicated dealing with the heat. It was ok apartment, but going to see Prague i would look for closer apartment. You can reach any place within 20-30min by tram.  Overall good apartment which provides garage parking.",,,

The location is perfect, just outside the very touristy parts of Prague, but just a short walk to the bridges, heart of the Mala Strana, and lots of parks.

24715,translation,"Excellent location and beautiful, spacious and centrally located flat.",,,Thank you very much for everything!
24714,original,"The apartment was just like in the photos. It was also very secure - within an apartment complex. Communication with the host was excellent.
There was a large bathroom and a smaller powder room/ toilet which was very good.
Lovely balconies to enjoy your morning coffee - with a beautiful view of the trees.
The only downside ( which was quite significant for us) was the absence of a microwave ( mentioned in the list of amenities) and toaster.",,,"The absence of a microwave and toaster was quite significant for us ( I had actually filtered my search to include microwaves).
Given the rather high price paid I would expect this to be part of the amenities.
Would  also recommend capsules ( sufficient in number) for the washing machine and installing a proper dryer. 

Otherwise picture perfect apartment !"

24711,translation,"We spent an extended weekend in the flat with our family (2+2). There was enough space for everyone - two bedrooms, 2 bathrooms - one with a bathtub, the other with a shower and an additional toilet on the ground floor, a large kitchen connected to the open dining room with a glass ceiling - a very attractive layout of the flat, a lot of comfort, more space than it seems on the pictures, additionally a small balcony with an electric grill. Everything you need for a stay in Prague with family, friends, short or long. flat equipped with washing machine, clothes dryer, dishwasher, smart TV with Netflix😜.
We recommend everyone who wants to visit Prague. The location allows you to get to the centre very quickly ...on foot, Prague's great public transport and the good location of the flat near the most important bus stops makes it easy to get everywhere. The flat is 1 or 2 blocks away from the National Museum in Prague, 5 minutes on foot, lots of grocery shops, restaurants, breakfast bars.",,,"our only comments are small things to improve for the future:
-the state of the equipment with rubbish bags, dishwasher cubes, washing up liquid, etc -to be supplemented because some of these things were missing or not there at all during our stay
-while overall the flat was clean, fresh linen, bathrooms clean, the state of dust on the floor to be improved 😜.
we take into account that we were anxious to check in early and the lack of replenishment and lack of thorough cleaning of the flat may have been due to the rush.
apart from that, everything was perfect.
Great flat and very nice layout.
As soon as we have the opportunity we would love to come back. if you can accommodate us.
best regards"

Old town square and historic centre within walking distance in 20 to 25 minutes.
Small shop and bakery at the foot of the building.
Perfect",,,"Hello
We had a very good stay and were in good shape for the marathon.
The flat was clean and conformed to the photos.
To improve the stay, it would be necessary to add a box of handkerchief (in spring, there are allergies 🤧 to pollens), and it would be necessary duvets a little larger. They were a bit small.
Thank you for being available
Bonne continuation
Stéphane"
24705,original,"We stayed at the AirBnB for 5 nights.  The host was extremely helpful with reccomending places to visit, and the check in process was very easy. the AirBnB is in a awesome location, right next to a metro entrance, with great links to where ever you need to go. there is a beautiful chapel outside the apartment with a nice park area to relax in. There is a great kebab shop right next door which if you stay here I would definatley reccomend! 
The city itself is gorgeous, one of the best I have ever been too  and always felt safe wherever we went.
There was a small issue with the AirBnB which was out of the owners control, which we made them aware of, and they assured us it was the first time it had happened. Their communication was amazing throughout and even suggested someone come out straight away to take a look. Because of how understand and how good the communication was it didnt effect our stay at all! 
Highly reccomend this AirBnb to anyone looking for a good location in Prague!",,,

24699,original,Wonderful place!,,,
24698,original,"Great location, not noisy, easy to find and overall very pleasant.",,,
24697,original,"At first I thought it was a bit shoddy because it could do with a couple of lights and a chair being fixed and I couldn’t turn off the heating. But I grew to love the space and the calm and the building is beautiful and the neighbours are friendly. And the area is just the most lovely place we found in Prague! We spent much more time local to the flat than we imagined we would because it’s such a great area. And the flat really is lovely, we would go back for sure.",,,"Hello. The heating is v hard to control we never got to the bottom of it. One chair is cracked and makes noises when you sit on it so might need replacing. The handle to the shower room is wobbly. 3 lights are hanging out of the ceiling. The two jigsaws we did had pieces missing! Also two sets of keys or use of the intercom system is desirable. 

But we loved it thanks! Just thought we would let you know about the above."

It was the perfect spot to come back to after a day of exploring Prague. Check-in was really easy and communication with the Prague Days team was smooth and helpful. Definitely a great choice if you’re visiting the city!",,,
24694,translation,"The location, cleanliness, size and style of the apartment is very good. Only the check-out time 1000 is very early and there is no place to leave the suitcases, so if your flight is in the evening, you need to find another solution for luggage.",,,I think a place for bike suitcases can be arranged if the exit is made at 1000
24693,original,"Fantastic location, very clean and large space to stay. Would come here again if in Prague!",,,
24692,original,"The apartment was as pictured—stylish, comfortable, and in a good location. Note: there's noise as described, so not ideal for light sleepers. The electronic locks malfunctioned, and we had to wait 27 minutes for the host to reset them—unfortunately during our kids’ dinnertime.

The poor rating is due to the host being misleading about amenities, even when asked before booking. They only acknowledged their mistake after a formal complaint was raised and after Airbnb intervened post check out. Had they simply admitted the error and worked with the guest toward a solution, this would be a positive review.

The listing has since been updated to reflect additional paid features—but exact costs are still missing. Future travelers should be aware of potential undisclosed fees, which led to confusion and frustration during our stay. Hopefully, they improve their transparency and customer service.",,,"I gave you many opportunities to fix the error and work with me. I am disappointed it came to this and that you even lied to Airbnb saying i did not call you and report the issues. 

Next time a simple ""yes I can see how you would be confused by our mistake however we will update xx to make it correct. We will agree half way on the costs"" would have solved the issue early and saved us both so much time and effort. 

Also please ensure the hot water system isnt on a timer or anything for the next guests"
24691,original,"Nice apartment, equipped kitchen. Clean place. Right next to tram stop which is pros because you can quickly get to city center but also a con because you can easily hear all cars and trams especially with open window.

The apartment is directly connected to the multi-storey car park and the reception hall is guarded by a porter. There is currently a large building site next door which causes noise during the week. The windows are quite soundproof and insulate the whole thing well. The price is therefore certainly still very acceptable at the moment and it was worth every cent.

It should be noted that access to the apartment is partially inaccessible. The elevator does not reach the ground floor, and does not reach the apartment floor so you have to climb about 15 steps and does not reach the entrance to the apartment so you have to go down or up about 10 steps.

24653,translation,"House very well located to see all of Prague
From this house you can walk to all the main areas of Prague Everything was found to be in perfect order and great policing
 I am very happy with this choice I would especially like to thank the organisers who were always ready for every request and information",,,bravo
24651,translation,"Very nice apartment!
Great location, close to the centre. There is a tram stop right next to the house, with a lot of trams that can take you almost everywhere.
There is a private parking space in the garage, a large terrace.
The owner was quick to respond and help!
When we come to Prague again, we will definitely rent this apartment if possible!
I recommend it to everyone!",,,"Thank you for the nice accommodation, we have no complaints.
There were only two strange things.
The TV turned on and woke up several times at night, I never understood why)))
And the fridge did not make ice, but that's more of a quirk 😁
Thank you for your pleasant stay there!"
24650,original,"great apartment with a spacious living room right in the heart of Prague, you get get to the tram and metro fast. the host is very responsive and the apartment itself was great",,,everything was great the only thing that was missing was an extra towel as we also had a baby which was stated in the accomodation. nothing major but I'm mentioning it in case it helps you on how you process the toddler information as I know Airbnb doesn't really count them as guests. Soaps and shampoos where very nice touch :)
24649,translation,"Very nice, large flat 2 steps from Wenceslas Square. The very precise directions made it very easy to find the flat and to park our car in the underground car park. Everything was as described and even bigger than the photos suggested.  The flat is beautifully decorated and very well equipped. Perhaps it lacks a wardrobe and hangers for storing clothes, but that's just a detail. The flat is also very quiet and the ideal starting point for visiting the city. We really enjoyed our stay here.",,,Many thanks again for the lovely flat you provided for us. It contributed greatly to making our stay in Prague an unforgettable one. All the best to you
24648,translation,"Very good location, tram right outside the front door, only a few minutes' walk to the centre. We spent very little time in the flat - the beds are comfortable, the sofa bed is unfortunately unusable for sleeping. In this respect, I would recommend the accommodation for a maximum of 4 people. (There are also only 4 armchairs.) The water temperature control in the shower works poorly, which was very unpleasant and annoying, especially for the children.
The communication was great - very quick and helpful. We were also allowed to check in earlier. Overall recommendable.",,,
24647,translation,"L 'accommodation in was average apart from a few problems related to lack of maintenance such as window handles that will remain in hand, dishwasher that did not work properly, light bulb of the kitchen table that was missing and I had to replace it with another of the house, also the first night the lift was stuck on the 3rd floor and was fixed the next day.
The thing that I just can not get down is the fact that I had chosen this property because it had private parking under the house (and having three small children with pram in tow was a fundamental thing for us) but it is NOT THAT! the car park is unusable because of the small size of access and maneuvering (you can only park cars always with difficulty, but I warn) after I reported my problem the response from the host was to advise me to pay parking obviously very expensive and far 20 min. walk from the flat!",,,You caused me a lot of inconvenience because of the car park I could not use due to your unclear directions.
24646,translation,"The holiday flat is very large and well furnished. However, the beds were prepared differently than described. There was no room with 2 single beds, but the couch was made up. Beds are firm but comfortable. All bedrooms face the street, where a tram runs every 2 minutes and a lot of cars. Sleeping with the windows open was not possible. We were given earplugs and sleep masks as a welcome gift. Otherwise conveniently located. We had a massive problem on arrival. We couldn't get into the underground car park because the remote control wasn't there. We stood in the short driveway for over an hour until luckily a neighbour opened it for us. We were then able to get into the garage, but not out again as there was no remote control for the door. We also had to get help from a third party when we left. There was also no TV, Wi-Fi (which was quickly replaced) and a microwave. Apparently there was a break-in before we arrived. The service hotline was nice.",,,Everything has already been said so far.
24645,translation,"Everything was super professional and super nice. I had specified one person too few when booking. The contact was super straightforward, so we were able to resolve this quickly. The location is really good, everything is within easy walking distance",,,
24644,translation,We are very happy to have spent our holiday in this apartment! After walking/excursions in Prague we always wanted to come back. The apartment is very quiet and cosy. We had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. Thank you!,,,"First of all, thank you for the beautiful apartment.
Just a few little things that could be fixed:
1. The table is not very stable in the living room (the table top is a bit wobbly).
2. The tap above the sink in the shower room is not very sturdy.
These are absolute trifles compared to the pleasure we had staying with you.
We are very happy to have been your guests and thank you again."
24643,original,"Great apartment and location, especially if you don’t like being right in the middle of tourist areas, but still close enough that it’s a short trip. Stocked with all of the necessities and amenities. Full kitchen with dishes, pots/pans and utensils. Really nice were the external blinds a on all windows for lazy mornings. Washer/dryer, drying rack, iron and ironing board were great to have. Tram stop right out front made all of Prague easily accessible. Pick up tram/bus. & metro maps at the info booth 1st floor terminal 1 in the airport. TV had access to a guest Netflix account. Bring your own streaming device , HDMI connections were available. Communication was great Prague Days responded to all inquires in a timely manner. Thanks for a great 1st visit to Prague!",,,"A quick how to use sheet on washer and dryer. In Czech would be fine, I had to use google translate on the manual for English.
A toaster would be nice but I managed to do it in frying pan. I couldn’t figure out hot to turn on stovetop exhaust fan so just opened the windows. 
Extra trash bags and where to take trash info.
Great apartment, well stocked. We really enjoyed our stay"
24642,original,"Great Spot at Prague 3, the neighborhood is amazing with lots of local bars and cafes. The apartment is as described in the listing, and the host was very responsive.",,,
24641,translation,"Very good, and very well placed!",,,
24640,translation,"We had an excellent stay in Prague.
The accommodation is exactly as described, ideally located in an area where you meet more Czechs than tourists, and close to two tram stations that take you to all the city's points of interest. The facilities offered are of a high standard. The underground car park (very clean and easily accessible) is also a real plus.
Communication with Prague Days is clear and detailed, and the host responds very quickly to enquiries.
We highly recommend this rental!",,,
24639,original,Comfortable and beautiful place. Well located and with the best support.,,,"It was awesome! There were some sockets and stuff under the bed, but so far, it was clean and comfortable. Thank you for answering as fast as you did !"
24638,translation,"Very quiet (overlooking the inner garden of the block). Close to Flora on one side (shopping centre where you can find everything and metro station that takes you to the centre in a few minutes) and JZP on the other (square with lively bars and restaurants).

The decor is original and fun.

We had an extremely pleasant stay.",,,"Some useful kitchen items could have been added: kitchen towels, small knife, peeler knife. We had to buy them.

Also, the mattress is not of good quality. After a few days, it triggered sciatica.

Despite this, the stay was pleasant."
24636,original,Very comfortable and quiet apartment on the first floor in the center of Prague just a few minutes walk from the Charles bridge.  Note that there is a coffee maker but no coffee capsules provided so bring your own. There was also a French press to ground coffee worked too. The unit and the building were modern and spacious and left us with a great impression. Highly recommended!,,,Please include coffee capsules for future guests! Thanks!
24635,original,Perfect stay dont miss it,,,
24634,original,"An ideal place to stay when exploring Prague. The apartment itself was immaculately clean and tidy, and the floor to ceiling windows capture such lovely sunsets from the bedrooms. The hosts were extremely fast at communicating, and helpful with advising us when an event was going on during our trip. Would definitely return again and recommend to others!",,,Thank you for the stay at this lovely apartment. I thought it was worth mentioning that we couldn't find any oven gloves in the place which made it difficult to improvise when cooking with the oven & it may be a helpful addition for future guests. 😊

24630,translation,"Very clean accommodation, as described and extremely well located for visiting the beautiful city of Prague.",,,"The fact that the access codes had changed on the same day put us in a difficult position as we had no access to the internet or to our emails (coming from abroad). We tried all the key boxes unsuccessfully several times, resulting in stress and wasted time."
24629,original,Very good communication with host. All amenities were available,,,
24628,original,"We had an amazing stay. The apartment is located in the city center with a ton of great restaurant options nearby. The apartment itself was spacious, we had 4 guests and plenty of room for everyone. All appliances were modern and the apartment had everything we needed for an enjoyable stay. Would recommend this spot to anyone visiting Prague!",,,
24627,translation,"New, fully equipped flat. There is a washing machine, dryer, oven, dishwasher, garage. Very much to the plus of the blinds in the windows, which completely covered the windows. Communication was clear and transparent. Highly recommended :)",,,
24626,original,"very confortable apartment for 5 people. super clean, lot of space and superb and fully furnished kitchen. host always in contact, proactive and responsive. the area is 20 minutes drive from center but it is very green and full of services. ideal location for us!!! thanks",,,"hi people, just a few suggestions as a superhost on airbnb: on my opinion you should find a better location for the key box. if you do not look carefully at the picture you sent (not everybody cares and not every tourist has internet connection anroad) it is quite difficult and weird to find! 
Also: elevator is not working good. it was stuck the whole weekend and it was very hard to takeour  heavy luggage down when moving out... 
allthe rest was perfect!!! if you come to rome or turkey (kas) let me know and i will be happy to host you or your friends!!! https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/19833860?source_impression_id=p3_1671094892_CSdXB2hCZGOIiLYj&modal=PHOTO_TOUR_SCROLLABLE"

Quiet, nicely furnished and very clean. There was enough space for four people.
We would love to come back!",,,"Super!!! Great flat, clean and nicely furnished."
24620,original,Thoroughly enjoyed the stay at Prague Days,,,Just would be useful to know that we sometimes had difficulty entering the flat after correctly inputting the pan. We had to intentionally pull the door handle toward us and down otherwise the door would not open.
24619,translation,"I liked it very much, a romantic place on the balcony.
Ideal for a family!",,,The garland on the balcony did not work
24618,translation,"The flat is very nice, as shown in the pictures. Location great. Only the cleanliness could be improved a bit - bathroom was not completely clean, there are stains on the floor and on the dining table.",,,
